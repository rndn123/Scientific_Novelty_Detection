UPC - CORE : What Can Machine Translation Evaluation Metrics and Wikipedia Do for Estimating Semantic Textual Similarity ?
abstract
In this paper we discuss our participation to the 2013 Semeval Semantic Textual Similarity task .
Our core features include ( i ) a set of metrics borrowed from automatic machine translation , originally intended to evaluate automatic against reference translations and ( ii ) an instance of explicit semantic analysis , built upon opening paragraphs of Wikipedia 2010 articles .
Our similarity estimator relies on a support vector regressor with RBF kernel .
Our best approach required 13 machine translation metrics + explicit semantic analysis and ranked 65 in the competition .
Our postcompetition analysis shows that the features have a good expression level , but overfitting and - mainly - normalization issues caused our correlation values to decrease .
Introduction
Our participation to the 2013 Semantic Textual Similarity task ( STS ) ( Agirre et al. , 2013 ) 1 was focused on the CORE problem : GIVEN TWO SENTENCES , s 1 AND s 2 , QUANTIFIABLY INFORM ON HOW SIMI - LAR s 1 AND s 2 ARE .
We considered real-valued features from four different sources : ( i ) a set of linguistic measures computed with the Asiya Toolkit for Automatic MT Evaluation ( Gim?nez and M?rquez , 2010 b ) , ( ii ) an instance of explicit semantic analysis ( Gabrilovich and Markovitch , 2007 ) , built on top of Wikipedia articles , ( iii ) a dataset predictor , and ( iv ) a subset of the features available in Takelab 's Semantic Text Similarity system ( ?ari? et al. , 2012 ) . 1 http://ixa2.si.ehu.es/sts/
Our approaches obtained an overall modest result compared to other participants ( best position : 65 out of 89 ) .
Nevertheless , our post-competition analysis shows that the low correlation was caused mainly by a deficient data normalization strategy .
The paper distribution is as follows .
Section 2 offers a brief overview of the task .
Section 3 describes our approach .
Section 4 discuss our experiments and obtained results .
Section 5 provides conclusions .
Task Overview
Detecting two similar text fragments is a difficult task in cases where the similarity occurs at semantic level , independently of the implied lexicon ( e.g in cases of dense paraphrasing ) .
As a result , similarity estimation models must involve features other than surface aspects .
The STS task is proposed as a challenge focused in short English texts of different nature : from automatic machine translation alternatives to human descriptions of short videos .
The test partition also included texts extracted from news headlines and FrameNet-Wordnet pairs .
The range of similarity was defined between 0 ( no relation ) up to 5 ( semantic equivalence ) .
The gold standard values were averaged from different human-made annotations .
The expected system 's output was composed of a real similarity value , together with an optional confidence level ( our confidence level was set constant ) .
Table 1 gives an overview of the development ( 2012 training and test ) and test datasets .
Note that both collections extracted from SMT data are highly biased towards the maximum similarity values ( more than 75 % of the instances have a similar -
Approach
Our similarity assessment model relies upon SVM light 's support vector regressor , with RBF kernel ( Joachims , 1999 ) .
2
Our model estimation procedure consisted of two steps : parameter definition and backward elimination - based feature selection .
The considered features belong to four families , briefly described in the following subsections .
Machine Translation Evaluation Metrics
We consider a set of linguistic measures originally intended to evaluate the quality of automatic translation systems .
These measures compute the quality of a translation by comparing it against one or several reference translations , considered as gold standard .
A straightforward application of these measures to the problem at hand is to consider s 1 as the reference and s 2 as the automatic translation , or vice versa .
Some of the metrics are not symmetric so we compute similarity between s 1 and s 2 in both directions and average the resulting scores .
The measures are computed with the Asiya Toolkit for Automatic MT Evaluation ( Gim?nez and M?rquez , 2010 b ) .
The only pre-processing carried out was tokenization ( Asiya performs additional inbox pre-processing operations , though ) .
We consid-ered a sample from three similarity families , which was proposed in ( Gim?nez and M?rquez , 2010a ) as a varied and robust metric set , showing good correlation with human assessments .
3 Semantic Similarity
Three measures that estimate the similarities over semantic roles ( i.e. arguments and adjuncts ) : SR - O r , SR - M r ( ? ) , and SR - O r ( ? ) .
Additionally , two metrics that estimate similarities over discourse representations : DR - O r ( ? ) and DR - O rp ( ? ) .
Lexical Similarity
Explicit Semantic Analysis
We built an instance of Explicit Semantic Analysis ( ESA ) ( Gabrilovich and Markovitch , 2007 ) with the first paragraph of 100k Wikipedia articles ( dump from 2010 ) .
Pre-processing consisted of tokenization and lemmatization .
Dataset Prediction
Given the similarity shifts in the different datasets ( cf. Table 1 ) , we tried to predict what dataset an instance belonged to on the basis of its vocabulary .
We built binary maxent classifiers for each dataset in the development set , resulting in five dataset likelihood features : dMSRpar , dSMTeuroparl , dMSRvid , dOnWN , and dSMTnews .
4 Pre-processing consisted of tokenization and lemmatization .
Baseline
We considered the features included in the Takelab Semantic Text Similarity system ( ? ari? et al. , 2012 ) , one of the top-systems in last year competition .
This system is used as a black box .
The resulting features are named tklab n , where n = [ 1 , 21 ] .
Our runs departed from three increasing subsets of features : AE machine translation evaluation metrics and explicit semantic analysis , AED the previous set plus dataset prediction , and AED T the previous set plus Takelab 's baseline features ( cf. Table 3 ) .
We performed a feature normalization , which relied on the different feature 's distribution over the entire dataset .
Firstly , features were bounded in the range ?3 * ?
2 in order to reduce the potentially negative impact of outliers .
Secondly , we normalized according to the z-score ( Nardo et al. , 2008 , pp. 28 , 84 ) ; i.e. x = ( x ? ? ) / ?.
As a result , each realvalued feature distribution in the dataset has ? = 0 and ? = 1 . During the model tuning stage we tried with other numerous normalization options : normalizing each dataset independently , together with the training set , and without normalization at all .
Normalizing according to the entire dev-test dataset led to the best results
Experiments and Results Section 4.1 describes our model tuning strategy .
Sections 4.2 and 4.3 discuss the official and postcompetition results .
Model Tuning
We used only the dev-train partition ( 2012 training ) for tuning .
By means of a 10 - fold cross validation process , we defined the trade-off ( c ) , gamma ( ? ) , and tube width ( ? ) parameters for the regressor and performed a backward -elimination feature selection process ( Witten and Frank , 2005 , p. 294 ) , independently for the three experiments .
The results for the cross-validation process are summarized in Table 2 .
The three runs allow for correlations higher than 0.8 .
On the one hand , the best regressor parameters obtain better results as more features are considered , still with very small differences .
On the other hand , the low correlation increase after the feature selection step shows that a few features are indeed irrelevant .
A summary of the features considered in each experiment ( also after feature selection ) is displayed in Table 3 .
The correlation obtained over the dev-test partition are corr AE = 0.7269 , corr AED = 0.7638 , and corr AED T = 0.8044 - it would have appeared in the top - 10 ranking of the 2012 competition .
Official Results
We trained three new regressors with the features considered relevant by the tuning process , but using the entire development dataset .
The test 2013 partition was normalized again by means of z-score , considering the means and standard deviations of the entire test dataset .
Table 4 displays the official results .
Our best approach - AE - , was positioned in rank 65 .
The worst results of run AED can be explained by the difference in the nature of the test respect to The reason behind this behavior can be in the difference of vocabularies respect to that stored in the Takelab system ( it includes only the vocabulary of the development partition ) .
This could be the same reason behind the drop in performance with respect to the results previously obtained on the dev-test partition ( cf. Section 4.1 ) .
Post-Competition Results
Our analysis of the official results showed the main issue was normalization .
Thus , we performed a manifold of new experiments , using the same configuration as in run AE , but applying other normalization strategies : ( a ) z-score normalization , but ignoring the FNWN dataset ( given its shift through low values ) ; ( b) z-score normalization , but considering independent means and standard deviations for each test dataset ; and ( c ) without normalizing any of dataset ( including the regressor one ) .
Table 5 includes the results . ( a ) makes evident that the instances in FNWN represent " anomalies " that harm the normalized values of the rest of subsets .
Run ( b ) shows that normalizing the test sets Estimating the adequate similarities over FNWN seems particularly difficult for our systems .
We observe two main factors .
( i) FNWN presents an important similarity shift respect to the other datasets : nearly 90 % of the instances similarity is lower than 2.5 and ( ii ) the average lengths of s 1 and s 2 are very different : 30 vs 9 words .
These characteristics made it difficult for our MT evaluation metrics to estimate proper similarity values ( be normalized or not ) .
We performed two more experiments over FNWN : training regressors with ESA as the only feature , before and after normalization .
The correlation was 0.16017 and 0.3113 , respectively .
That is , the normalization mainly affects the MT features .
Conclusions
In this paper we discussed on our participation to the 2013 Semeval Semantic Textual Similarity task .
Our approach relied mainly upon a combination of automatic machine translation evaluation metrics and explicit semantic analysis .
Building an RBF support vector regressor with these features allowed us for a modest result in the competition ( our best run was ranked 65 out of 89 ) .
Two metrics of TranslationError Rate ( Snover et al. , 2006 ) ( i.e. the estimated human effort to convert s 1 into s 2 ) : - TER and - TER pA .
Two measures of lexical precision : BLEU ( Papineni et al. , 2002 ) andNIST ( Doddington , 2002 ) .
One measure of lexical recall : ROUGE W ( Lin and Och , 2004 ) .
Finally , four variants of METEOR ( Banerjee and Lavie , 2005 ) ( exact , stemming , synonyms , and paraphrasing ) , a lexical metric accounting for F - Measure .
Syntactic Similarity
Three metrics that estimate the similarity of the sentences over dependency parse trees ( Liu and Gildea , 2005 ) : DP-HWCMi c - 4 for grammatical categories chains , DP - HWCMi r - 4 over grammatical relations , and DP - O r ( ? ) over words ruled by non-terminal nodes .
Also , one measure that estimates the similarity over constituent parse trees : CP -STM 4 ( Liu and Gildea , 2005 ) .

Run ( c ) is com - pletely different : not normalizing any dataset - both in development and test-reduces the influ- ence of the datasets to each other and allows for the best results .
Indeed , this configuration would have advanced practically forty positions at competition time , locating us in rank 27 .
We also tried with linear kernels , but RBF always obtained better results .
