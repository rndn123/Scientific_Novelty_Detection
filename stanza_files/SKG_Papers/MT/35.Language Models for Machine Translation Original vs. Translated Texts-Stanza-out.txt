Language Models for Machine Translation : Original vs. Translated Texts
abstract
We investigate the differences between language models compiled from original target - language texts and those compiled from texts manually translated to the target language .
Corroborating established observations of Translation Studies , we demonstrate that the latter are significantly better predictors of translated sentences than the former , and hence fit the reference set better .
Furthermore , translated texts yield better language models for statistical machine translation than original texts .
Introduction Statistical machine translation ( MT ) uses large target language models ( LMs ) to improve the fluency of generated texts , and it is commonly assumed that for constructing language models , " more data is better data " ( Brants and Xu , 2009 ) .
Not all data , however , are created the same .
In this work we explore the differences between LMs compiled from texts originally written in the target language and LMs compiled from translated texts .
The motivation for our work stems from much research in Translation Studies that suggests that original texts are significantly different from translated ones in various aspects ( Gellerstam , 1986 ) .
Recently , corpus-based computational analysis corroborated this observation , and Kurokawa et al . ( 2009 ) apply it to statistical machine translation , showing that for an English - to - French MT system , a translation model trained on an English -translated - to - French parallel corpus is better than one trained on French - translated - to - English texts .
Our research question is whether a language model compiled from translated texts may similarly improve the results of machine translation .
We test this hypothesis on several translation tasks , where the target language is always English .
For each language pair we build two English language models from two types of corpora : texts originally written in English , and human translations from the source language into English .
We show that for each language pair , the latter language model better fits a set of reference translations in terms of perplexity .
We also demonstrate that the differences between the two LMs are not biased by content but rather reflect differences on abstract linguistic features .
Research in Translation Studies suggests that all translated texts , irrespective of source language , share some so-called translation universals .
Consequently , translated texts from several languages to a single target language resemble each other along various axes .
To test this hypothesis , we compile additional English LMs , this time using texts translated to English from languages other than the source .
Again , we use perplexity to assess the fit of these LMs to reference sets of translated - to - English sentences .
We show that these LMs depend on the source language and differ from each other .
Whereas they outperform original - based LMs , LMs compiled from texts that were translated from the source language still fit the reference set best .
Finally , we train phrase - based MT systems ( Koehn et al. , 2003 ) for each language pair .
We use four types of LMs : original ; translated from the source language ; translated from other languages ; and a mixture of translations from several languages .
We show that the translatedfrom-source - language LMs provide a significant improvement in the quality of the translation output over all other LMs , and that the mixture LMs always outperform the original LMs .
This improvement persists even when the original LMs are up to ten times larger than the translated ones .
The main contributions of this work are therefore a computational corroboration of the hypotheses that 1 . original and translated texts exhibit significant , measurable differences ; 2 . LMs compiled from translated texts better fit translated references than LMs compiled from original texts of the same ( and much larger ) size ( and , to a lesser extent , LMs compiled from texts translated from languages other than the source language ) ; and 3 . MT systems that use LMs based on manually translated texts significantly outperform LMs based on originally written texts .
It is important to emphasize that translated texts abound :
Many languages , especially lowresource ones , are more likely to have translated texts ( religious scripts , educational materials , etc. ) than original ones .
Some numeric data are listed in Pym and Chrupa la ( 2005 ) .
Furthermore , such data can be automatically identified ( see Section 2 ) .
The practical impact of our work on MT is therefore potentially dramatic .
This paper is organized as follows : Section 2 provides background and describes related work .
We explain our research methodology and resources in Section 3 and detail our experiments and results in Section 4 .
Section 5 discusses the results and their implications .
Background and Related Work Numerous studies suggest that translated texts are different from original ones .
Gellerstam ( 1986 ) compares texts written originally in Swedish and texts translated from English into Swedish .
He notes that the differences between them do not indicate poor translation but rather a statistical phenomenon , which he terms translationese .
He focuses mainly on lexical differences , for example less colloquialism in the translations , or foreign words used in the translations " with new shades of meaning taken from the English lexeme " ( p.91 ) .
Only later studies consider grammatical differences ( see , e.g. , Santos ( 1995 ) ) .
The features of translationese were theoretically organized under the terms laws of translation and translation universals .
Toury ( 1980 Toury ( , 1995 distinguishes between two laws : the law of interference and the law of growing standardization .
The former pertains to the fingerprints of the source text that are left in the translation product .
The latter pertains to the effort to standardize the translation product according to existing norms in the target language ( and culture ) .
Interestingly , these two laws are in fact reflected in the architecture of statistical machine translation : interference corresponds to the translation model and standardization to the language model .
The combined effect of these laws creates a hybrid text that partly corresponds to the source text and partly to texts written originally in the target language but in fact belongs to neither ( Frawley , 1984 ) .
Baker ( 1993 Baker ( , 1995 Baker ( , 1996 suggests several candidates for translation universals , which are claimed to appear in any translated text , regardless of the source language .
These include simplification , the tendency of translated texts to simplify the language , the message or both ; and explicitation , their tendency to spell out implicit utterances that occur in the source text .
Baroni and Bernardini ( 2006 ) use machine learning techniques to distinguish between original and translated Italian texts , reporting 86.7 % accuracy .
They manage to abstract from content and perform the task using only morphosyntactic cues .
Ilisei et al. ( 2010 ) perform the same task for Spanish but enhance it theoretically in order to check the simplification hypothesis .
The most informative features are lexical variety , sentence length and lexical density .
van Halteren ( 2008 ) focuses on six languages from Europarl ( Koehn , 2005 ) : Dutch , English , French , German , Italian and Spanish .
For each of these languages , a parallel six-lingual subcorpus is extracted , including an original text and its translations into the other five languages .
The task is to identify the source language of translated texts , and the reported results are excellent .
This finding is crucial : as Baker ( 1996 ) states , translations do resemble each other ; however , in accordance with the law of interference , the study of van Halteren ( 2008 ) suggests that translation from different source languages constitute different sublanguages .
As we show in Section 4.2 , LMs based on translations from the source language outperform LMs compiled from non-source translations , in terms of both fitness to the reference set and improving MT .
Kurokawa et al. ( 2009 ) show that the direction of translation affects the performance of statistical MT .
They train systems to translate between French and English ( and vice versa ) using a French- translated - to - English parallel corpus , and then an English-translated - to - French one .
They find that in translating into French it is better to use the latter parallel corpus , and when translating into English it is better to use the former .
Whereas they focus on the translation model , we focus on the language model in this work .
We show that using a LM trained on a text translated from the source language of the MT system does indeed improve the results of the translation .
Methodology and Resources
Hypotheses
We investigate the following three hypotheses :
1 . Translated texts differ from original texts ; 2 . Texts translated from one language differ from texts translated from other languages ;
3 . LMs compiled from manually translated texts are better for MT as measured using BLEU than LMs compiled from original texts .
We test our hypotheses by considering translations from several languages to English .
For each language pair we create a reference set comprising several thousands of sentences written originally in the source language and manually translated to English .
Section 3.4 provides details on the reference sets .
To investigate the first hypothesis , we train two LMs for each language pair , one created from original English texts and the other from texts translated into English .
Then , we check which LM better fits the reference set .
Fitness of a LM to a set of sentences is measured in terms of perplexity ( Jelinek et al. , 1977 ; Bahl et al. , 1983 ) .
Given a language model and a test ( reference ) set , perplexity measures the predictive power of the language model over the test set , by looking at the average probability the model assigns to the test data .
Intuitively , a better model assigns higher probablity to the test data , and consequently has a lower perplexity ; it is less surprised by the test data .
Formally , the perplexity PP of a language model L on a test set W = w 1 w 2 . . . w N is the probability of W normalized by the number of words N Jurafsky and Martin ( 2008 , page 96 ) : PP ( L , W ) = N N i=1 1 P L ( w i |w 1 . . . w i?1 ) ( 1 )
For the second hypothesis , we extend the experiment to LMs created from texts translated from other languages to English .
For example , we test how well a LM trained on Frenchto- English - translated texts fits the German- to - English reference set ; and how well a LM trained on German-to - English - translated texts fits the French - to - English reference set .
Finally , for the third hypothesis , we use these LMs for statistical MT ( SMT ) .
For each language pair we build several SMT systems .
All systems use a translation model extracted from a parallel corpus which is oblivious to the direction of the translation ; and one of the abovementioned LMs .
Then , we compare the translation quality of these systems in terms of the BLEU metric ( Papineni et al. , 2002 ) .
Language Models
In all the experiments , we use SRILM ( Stolcke , 2002 ) to train 4 - gram language models ( with the default backoff model ) from various corpora .
Our main corpus is Europarl ( Koehn , 2005 ) , specifically portions collected over years 1996 to 365 1999 and 2001 to 2009 .
This is a large multilingual corpus , containing sentences translated from several European languages .
However , it is organized as a collection of bilingual corpora rather than as a single multilingual one , and it is hard to identify sentences that are translated to several languages .
We therefore treat each bilingual sub-corpus in isolation ; each such sub-corpus contains sentences translated from various languages .
We rely on the language attribute of the speaker tag to identify the source language of sentences in the English part of the corpus .
Since this tag is rarely used with English - language speakers , we also exploit the ID attribute of the speaker tag , which we match against the list of British members of the European parliament .
We focus on the following languages : German ( DE ) , French ( FR ) , Italian ( IT ) , and Dutch ( NL ) .
For each of these languages , L , we consider the L-English Europarl sub-corpus .
In each sub-corpus , we extract chunks of approximately 2.5 million English tokens translated from each of these source languages ( T- L ) , as well as sentences written originally in English ( O-EN ) .
The mixture corpus ( MIX ) , which is designed to represent " general " translated language , is constructed by randomly selecting sentences translated from any language ( excluding original English sentences ) .
Table 1 lists the number of sentences , number of tokens and average sentence length , for each sub-corpus and each original language .
In addition , we use the Hansard corpus , containing transcripts of the Canadian parliament from 1996 - 2007 1 .
This is a bilingual French - English corpus comprising about 80 % original English texts ( EO ) and about 20 % texts translated from French ( FO ) .
We first separate original English from the original French and then , for each original language , we randomly extract portions of texts of different sizes : 1 M , 5 M and 10M tokens from the FO corpus and 1M , 5M , 10M , 25 M , 50M and 100M tokens from the EO corpus ; see
SMT Training Data
To focus on the effect of the language model on translation quality , we design SMT training corpora to be oblivious to the direction of translation .
Again , we use Europarl ( January 2000 to September 2000 ) as the main source of our parallel corpora .
We also use the Hansard corpus :
We randomy extract 50,000 sentences from the original French sub-corpora and another 50,000 sentences from the original English sub-corpora .
For Hebrew we use the Hebrew - English parallel corpus ( Tsvetkov and Wintner , 2010 ) which contains sentences translated from Hebrew to English ( 54 % ) and from English to Hebrew ( 46 % ) .
The English- to - Hebrew part comprises many short sentences ( approximately 6 tokens per sentence ) taken from a movie subtitle database .
This explains the small token to sentence ratio of this particular corpus .
Reference Sets
The reference sets have two uses .
First , they are used as the test sets in the experiments that measure the perplexity of the language models .
Second , in the MT experiments we use them to randomly extract 1000 sentences for tuning and 1000 ( different ) sentences for evaluation .
For each language L we use the L-English subcorpus of Europarl ( over the period of October to December 2000 ) , containing only sentences originally produced in language L. The Hansard reference set is completely disjoint from the LM and SMT training sets and comprises only original French sentences .
The Hebrew- to- English reference set is an independent ( disjoint ) part of the Hebrew - to - English parallel corpus .
This set mostly comprises literary data ( 88.6 % ) and a small portion of news ( 11.4 % ) .
All sentences are originally written in Hebrew and are manually translated to English .
See Table 5 .
Experiments and Results
We detail in this section the experiments performed to test the three hypotheses : that translated texts can be distinguished from original ones , and provide better language models of other translated texts ; that texts translated from other languages than the source are still better predictors of translations than original texts ( Section 4.1 ) ; and that these differences are important for SMT ( Section 4.2 ) .
Lang
Translated vs. Original texts
We train several 4 - gram LMs for each Europarl sub-corpus , based on the corpora described in Section 3.2 .
For each language L , we train a LM based on texts translated from L , from languages other than L as well as texts originally written in English .
The LMs are applied to the reference set of texts translated from L , and we compute the perplexity : the fitness of the LM to the reference set .
Table 6 details the results , where for each sub-corpus and LM we list the number of unigrams in the test set , the number of out - of- vocabulary items ( OOV ) and the perplexity ( PP ) .
The lowest perplexity ( reflecting the best fit ) in each sub-corpus is typeset in boldface , and the highest ( worst fit ) is slanted .
These results overwhelmingly support our hypothesis .
For each language L , the perplexity of the LM that was created from L translations is lowest , followed immediately by the MIX LM .
Furthermore , the perplexity of the LM created from originally - English texts is highest in all experiments .
In addition , the perplexity of LMs constructed from texts translated from languages other than L always lies between these two extremes : it is a better fit of the reference set than original texts , but not as good as texts translated from L ( or mixture translations ) .
This corroborates the hypothesis that translations form a language in itself , and translations from L 1 to L 2 , form a sub-language , related to yet different from translations from other languages to L 2 .
A possible explanation for the different perplexity results between the LMs could be the specific contents of the corpora used to compile the LMs .
To rule out this possibility and to further emphasize that the corpora are indeed structurally different , we conduct more experiments , in which we gradually abstract away from the domain - and content-specific features of the texts and emphasize their syntactic structure .
We focus on German-to - English .
First , we remove all punctuation to eliminate possible bias due to differences in punctuation conventions .
Then , we use the Stanford Named Entity Recognizer ( Finkel et al. , 2005 ) to identify named entities , which we replace with a unique token ( ' NE ' ) .
Next , we replace all nouns with their POS tag ; we use the Stanford POS Tagger ( Toutanova and Manning , 2000 ) .
Finally , for full lexical abstraction , we replace all words with their POS tags .
At each step , we train six language models on O-and T-texts and apply them to the reference set ( adapted to the same level of abstraction , of course ) .
As the abstraction of the text increases , we also increase the order of the LMs : From 4 - grams for text without punctuation and NE abstraction to 5 - grams for noun abstraction to 8 - grams for full POS abstraction .
The results , which are depicted in Table 7 , consistently show that the T-based LM is a better fit to the reference set , albeit to a lesser extent .
While we do not show the details here , the same pattern is persistent in all the other Europarl languages we experiment with .
We repeat this experiment with the Hebrewto-English reference set .
We train two 4 - gram LMs on the O-EN and T-HE corpora .
We then apply the two LMs to the reference set and compute the perplexity .
The results are presented in Table 8 .
Although the T-based LM has more OOVs , it is a better fit to the translated text than the O-based LM : Its perplexity is lower by 20.1 % .
Interestingly , the O-corpus LM has more unique unigrams than the T-corpus LM , supporting the claim of Al - Shabab ( 1996 ) that translated texts have lower type-to-token ratio .
We also conduct the above-mentioned abstraction experiments .
The results , which are depicted in Table 9 , consistently show that the T-based LM is a better fit to the reference set .
Clearly , then , translated LMs better fit the references than original ones , and the differences can be traced back not just to ( trivial ) specific lexical choice , but also to syntactic structure , as evidenced by the POS abstraction experiments .
In fact , in order to retain the low perplexity level of translated texts , a LM based on original texts must be approximately ten times larger .
We establish this by experimenting with the Hansard
Original vs. Translated LMs for MT
The last hypothesis we test is whether a better fitting language model yields a better machine translation system .
In other words , we expect the T-based LMs to outperform the Obased LMs when used as part of an MT system .
We construct German-to-English , Frenchto-English , Italian - to - English and Dutch- to- English MT systems using the Moses phrasebased SMT toolkit .
The systems are trained on the parallel corpora described in Section 3.3 .
We use the reference sets ( Section 3.4 ) as follows : 1,000 sentences are randomly extracted for minimum error-rate tuning ( Och , 2003 ) , and another set of 1,000 sentences is randomly used for evaluation .
Each system is built and tuned with six different LMs : MIX , O-based and four T-based ( Section 3.2 ) .
We use BLEU ( Papineni et al. , 2002 ) to evaluate translation quality .
The results are listed in Table 10 .
These results are consistent : the translatedfrom-source systems outperform all other systems ; mixture models come second ; and systems that use original English LMs always perform worst .
We test the statistical significance of differences between various MT systems using the bootstrap resampling method ( Koehn , 2004 ) .
In all experiments , the best system ( translatedfrom-source LM ) is significantly better than all We also construct a Hebrew - to - English MT system using Moses ' factored translation model .
Every token in the training corpus is represented as two factors : surface form and lemma .
Moreover , the Hebrew input is fully segmented .
The system is built and tuned with O-and T-based LMs .
The LMs used in the above experiments are small .
We now want to assess whether the benefits of using translated LMs carry over to scenarios where large original corpora exist .
We build yet another set of French - to - English MT systems .
We use the Hansard SMT translation model and Hansard LMs to train nine MT systems , three with varying sizes of translated texts and six with varying sizes of original texts .
We tune and evaluate on the Hansard reference set .
In another set of experiments we use the Europarl French - to - English scenario ( using Europarl corpora for the translation model and for tuning and evaluation ) , but we use the nine Hansard LMs to see whether our findings are consistent also when LMs are trained on out-ofdomain ( but similar genre ) material .
Table 12 shows that the original English LMs should be enlarged by a factor of ten to achieve translation quality similar to that of translationbased LMs .
In other words , much smaller translated LMs perform better than much larger original ones , and this is true for various LM sizes .
In -Domain
Discussion
We use language models computed from different types of corpora to investigate whether their fitness to a reference set of translatedto- English sentences can differentiate between them ( and , hence , between the corpora on which they are based ) .
Our main findings are that LMs compiled from manually translated corpora are much better predictors of translated texts than LMs compiled from original - language corpora of the same size .
The results are robust , and are sustainable even when the corpora and the reference sentences are abstracted in ways that retain their syntactic structure but ignore specific word meanings .
Furthermore , we show that translated LMs are better predictors of translated sentences even when the LMs are compiled from texts translated from languages other than the source language .
However , LMs based on texts translated from the source language still outperform LMs translated from other languages .
We also show that MT systems based on translated - from-source - language LMs outperform MT systems based on originals LMs or LMs translated from other languages .
Again , these results are robust and the improvements are statistically significant .
This effect seems to be amplified as translation quality improves .
Furthermore , our results show that original LMs require ten times more data to exhibit the same fitness to the reference set and the same translation quality as translated LMs .
More generally , this study confirms that insights drawn from the field of theoretical translation studies , namely the dual claim according to which ( 1 ) translations as such differ from originals , and ( 2 ) translations from different source languages differ from each other , can be verified experimentally and contribute to the performance of machine translation .
Future research is needed in order to understand why this is the case .
One plausible hypothesis is that recurrent multiword expressions in the source language are frequently solved by human translations and each of these expressions converges to a set of high-quality translation equivalents which are represented in the LM .
Another hypothesis is that since translation - based LMs represent a simplified mode of language use , the error potential is smaller .
We therefore expect translation - based LMs to use more unmarked forms .
This work also bears on language typology : we conjecture that LMs compiled from texts translated not from the original language , but from a closely related one , can be better than texts translated from a more distant language .
Some of our results support this hypothesis , but more research is needed in order to establish it .

Table 10 : 10 Machine translation with various LMs other systems ( p < 0.05 ) ; ( even more ) significantly better than the O-EN system ( p < 0.01 ) ; and the mixture systems are significantly better than the O-EN systems ( p < 0.01 ) .
Table 11 depicts the performance of the systems .
The T-based LM yields a statistically better BLEU score than the O-based system .
