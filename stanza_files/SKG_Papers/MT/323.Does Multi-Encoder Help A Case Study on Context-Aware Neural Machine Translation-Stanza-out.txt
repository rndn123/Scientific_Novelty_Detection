Does Multi-Encoder Help ?
A Case Study on Context - Aware Neural Machine Translation
abstract
In encoder- decoder neural models , multiple encoders are in general used to represent the contextual information in addition to the individual sentence .
In this paper , we investigate multi-encoder approaches in document - level neural machine translation ( NMT ) .
Surprisingly , we find that the context encoder does not only encode the surrounding sentences but also behaves as a noise generator .
This makes us rethink the real benefits of multi-encoder in context - aware translation - some of the improvements come from robust training .
We compare several methods that introduce noise and / or well - tuned dropout setup into the training of these encoders .
Experimental results show that noisy training plays an important role in multi-encoder - based NMT , especially when the training data is small .
Also , we establish a new state - of- the - art on IWSLT Fr- En task by careful use of noise generation and dropout methods .
Introduction Sentence -level neural machine translation ( NMT ) systems ignore the discourse phenomena and encode the individual source sentences with no use of contexts .
In recent years , the context - aware models which learn contextual information from surrounding sentences have shown promising results in generating consistent and coherent translations Voita et al. , 2018 ; Kim et al. , 2019 ; Voita et al. , 2019 ; Bawden et al. , 2018 ; Miculicich et al. , 2018 ; Maruf and Haffari , 2018 ; Maruf et al. , 2019 ) .
There are two common approaches to incorporating contexts into NMT : the simple way is to concatenate the context and the current sentence * Corresponding author .
to form a context - aware input sequence ( Agrawal et al. , 2018 ; Tiedemann and Scherrer , 2017 ) , whereas a more widely - used approach utilizes additional neural networks to encode context sentences ( Jean et al. , 2017 ; Voita et al. , 2018 ; . Here we name the former as the single-encoder approach and name the latter as the multi-encoder approach .
However , large-scale document corpora are not easily available .
Most context - aware NMT systems are evaluated on small datasets and significant BLEU improvements are reported ( Wang et al. , 2017 ; .
In our experiments , we find that the improvement persists if we feed pseudo sentences into the context encoder , especially when we train the system on small-scale data .
A natural question here is :
How much does the improvement come from the leverage of contextual information in multi-encoder ?
In this work , we aim to investigate what kinds of information that the context - aware model captures .
We re-implement several widely used context - aware architectures based on the multiencoder paradigm , and do an in- depth analysis to study whether the context encoder captures the contextual information .
By conducting extensive experiments on several document- level translation benchmarks , we observe that : ?
The BLEU gaps between sentence - level and context - aware models decrease when the sentence baselines are carefully tuned , e.g. , proper use of dropout . ?
The multi-encoder systems are insensitive to the context input .
Even randomly sampled sentences can bring substantial improvements . ?
The model trained with the correct context can achieve better performance during inference without the context input .

Context
Our contribution is two folds : ( i ) We find that the benefit of the multi-encoder context - aware approach is not from the leverage of contextual information .
Instead , the context encoder acts more like a noise generator to provide richer training signals .
( ii )
The finding here inspires us to develop a simple yet effective training strategy : we add a Gaussian - noise to the encoder output , which can effectively alleviate the overfitting , especially on small datasets .
Approaches to Incorporating Contexts into NMT
Here we describe two ways of introducing contextual information into NMT systems .
The Single-Encoder Approach
The input of the single-encoder system is the concatenation of the context sentences and the current sentence , with a special symbol inserted to distinguish them ( Tiedemann and Scherrer , 2017 ; Agrawal et al. , 2018 ) .
Then the extended sentence is fed into the standard Transformer .
These systems may face the challenge of encoding extremely long inputs , resulting in inefficient computation .
The Multi-Encoder Approach
The multi-encoder models take the surrounding sentences as the context and employ an additional neural network to encode the context , that is , we have a source-sentence encoder and a context encoder .
Figure 1 shows two methods of integrating the context into NMT in the multi-encoder paradigm .
Next we show that most of the multi-encoder approaches ( Voita et al. , 2018 ; are instances of the models described below .
?
Outside integration .
As shown in Figure 1 ( a ) , the representations of the context and the current sentence are firstly transformed into a new representation by an attention network .
Then the attention output and the source sentence representation are fused by a gated sum .
?
Inside integration .
Alternatively , the decoder can attend to two encoders respectively ( Figure 1 ( b ) ) .
Then , the gating mechanism inside the decoder is employed to obtain the fusion vector .
3 Experimental Setup
Data and Settings
We evaluated the document- level approaches on several publicly available datasets .
For Chinese-English ( Zh-En ) and French -English ( Fr-En ) , we used Ted talks from IWSLT15 and IWSLT16 ( Cettolo et al. , 2012 ) evaluation campaigns as the training data .
We validated on dev2010 , and tested on tst2010 -2013 ( Zh-En ) , tst2010 ( Fr- En ) respectively .
For English - German ( En- De ) , we evaluated on WMT18 task 1 . For more convincing results , we also randomly sampled 500k / 1M/2M / 5 M sentence pairs from the Chinese-English corpus provided by WMT 2 and test on newstest2017 .
We preprocessed the sentences with Moses tokenizer segment words into sub-word units .
The Chinese sentences were word segmented by the tool provided within NiuTrans ( Xiao et al. , 2012 ) .
For Fr-En and Zh- En tasks , we lowercased all sentences to obtain comparable results with previous work .
We also conducted experiments on a larger English -Russian ( En - Ru ) dataset provided by Voita et al . ( 2018 ) , consisting of 2 M sentence pairs selected from publicly available OpenSubtitles 2018 corpus .
The data statistics of each language pair can be seen in Table 1 .
We chose the Transformer - base model as the sentence - level baseline .
The context encoder also used the same setting as the sentence - level baseline .
We used Adam ( Kingma and Ba , 2014 ) for optimization , and trained the systems on a single TiTan V GPU 4 .
The learning rate strategy was the same as that used in Vaswani et al . ( 2017 ) .
Our implementation was based on Fairseq ( Ott et al. , 2019 ) .
More details can be found in our repository 5 .
Results and Discussion
To study whether the context-encoder network captures contextual information in training , we present three types of context as the input of the contextencoder : ?
Context : the previous sentence of the current sentence .
?
Random : a sentence consisting of words randomly sampled from the source vocabulary .
?
Fixed : a fixed sentence input for contextencoder .
Baseline Selection Weight sharing ( Voita et al. , 2018 )
Results
Table 3 shows the results of several context - aware models on different datasets .
We see , first of all , that all multi-encoder models , including both Inside and Outside approaches outperform the sentencelevel baselines by a large margin on the Zh-En and En- De datasets with a small p value of dropout .
Also , there are modest BLEU improvements on the Fr-En and En- Ru tasks .
When the models are regularized by a larger dropout , all systems obtain substantial improvements - but the gaps between sentence - level and multi-encoder systems decrease significantly .
We deduce that if the context - aware systems rely on the contextual information from the preceding sentence , the performance of Random and Fixed should dramatically decrease due to the incorrect context .
Surprisingly , both Random and Fixed systems achieve comparable performance or even higher BLEU scores than Context in most cases ( See Table 3 ) .
A possible explanation is that the context encoder does not only model the context .
Instead , it acts more like a noise generator to provide additional supervised signals to train the sentence - level model .
Robust Training
To verify the assumption of robust training , we followed the work ( Srivastava et al. , 2014 ; Berger et al. , 1996 ) .
We turned off the context-encoder during the inference process , and made the inference system perform as the sentence - level baseline .
signed a simple yet effective method to regularize the training process :
A Gaussian noise is added to the encoder output instead of the embedding ( Cheng et al. , 2018 ) .
We sample a vector ?
N 0 , ? 2 I from a Gaussian distribution with variance ?
2 , where ? is a hyper-parameter .
As seen in Table 5 , the systems with Gaussian - noise significantly outperform the sentence - level baselines , and are slightly better than the Outside -context counterpart .
Moreover , a natural question is whether further improvement can be achieved by combining the Context with the Gaussian - noise method .
From the last line in Table 5 , we observe no more improvement at all .
The observation here convinced the assumption again that the context-encoder plays a similar role with the noise generator .
Large Scale Training Most previous results are reported on small training datasets .
Here we examine the effects of the noise - based method on different sized datasets .
We trained the Inside-Random model and the Gaussiannoise model on different datasets consisting of 500 K to 5 M sentence pairs .
Seen from Figure 2 , the baseline model achieves better translation performance when we increase the data size .
More interestingly , it is observed that Inside -Random and Gaussian - noise perform slightly better than the baseline , and the gaps gradually decrease with the volume increasing .
This is reasonable that models trained on large-scale data may suffer less from the overfitting problem .
Related Work Context - aware NMT systems incorporating the contextual information generate more consistent and coherent translations than sentence - level N - MT systems .
Most of the current context- aware NMT models can be classified into two main categories , single - encoder systems ( Tiedemann and Scherrer , 2017 ) and multi-encoder systems ( Jean et al. , 2017 ; Voita et al. , 2018 ; . For a fair evaluation of context- aware NMT methods , we argue that one should build a strong enough sentence - level baseline with carefully regularized methods , especially on small datasets ( Kim et al. , 2019 ; Sennrich and Zhang , 2019 ) .
Beyond this , Bawden et al . ( 2018 ) and Voita et al . ( 2019 ) acknowledged that BLEU score is insufficient to evaluate context - aware models , and they emphasized that multi-encoder architectures alone had a limited capacity to exploit discourse - level context .
In this work , we take a further step to explore the main cause , showing that the context- encoder acts more like a noise generator , and the BLEU improve-ments mainly come from the robust training instead of the leverage of contextual information .
Additionally , Cheng et al. ( 2018 ) added the Gaussian noise to word embedding to simulate lexical - level perturbations for more robust training .
Differently , we added the Gaussian noise to the encoder output which plays a similar role with context-encoder , which provides additional training signals .
Conclusions
We have shown that , in multi-encoder contextaware NMT , the BLEU improvement is not attributed to the leverage of contextual information .
Even though we feed the incorrect context into training , the NMT system can still obtain substantial BLEU improvements on several small datasets .
Another observation is that the NMT models can even achieve better translation quality without the context encoder .
This gives us an interesting finding that the context-encoder acts more like a noise generator , which provides rich supervised training signals for robust training .
Motivated by this , we significantly improve the sentence - level systems with a Gaussian noise imposed on the encoder output .
Experiments on large-scale training data demonstrate the effectiveness of this method .

We first evaluated the importance of two training strategies for multi-encoder systems .
We selected the multiencoder with Outside integration ( see Section 2 ) as the context - aware model and trained systems with two training strategies on the En- De task respectively .

The model with two -stage training performs slightly better than the weightsharing system in terms of BLEU .
To our surprise , the context-encoder with a single - layer can compete with a six-layers model .
We suspect that this is because the training data is limited and we do not need a sophisticated model to fit it .
Therefore , we choose the two -stage training and single - layer context- encoder for all experiments in the remainder of this paper .

This confirms that the in- formation extracted by context- encoder just plays a role like introducing randomness into training ( e.g. , dropout ) , which is a popular method used in robust statistics .
We argue that three types of context provide noise signals to disturb the distri- bution of the sentence - level encoder output .
The BLEU improvements of both Outside and Inside are mainly due to the richer noise signals which can effectively alleviate the overfitting .
