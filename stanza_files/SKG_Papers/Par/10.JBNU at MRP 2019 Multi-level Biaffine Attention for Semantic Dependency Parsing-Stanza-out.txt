JBNU at MRP 2019 : Multi-level Biaffine Attention for Semantic Dependency Parsing
abstract
This paper describes Jeonbuk National University ( JBNU ) 's system for the 2019 shared task on Cross -Framework Meaning Representation Parsing ( MRP 2019 ) at the Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning .
Of the five frameworks , we address only the DELPH -IN MRS Bi-Lexical Dependencies ( DP ) , Prague Semantic Dependencies ( PSD ) , and Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation ( UCCA ) frameworks .
We propose a unified parsing model using biaffine attention ( Dozat and Manning , 2017 ) , consisting of 1 ) a BERT - BiLSTM encoder and 2 ) a biaffine attention decoder .
First , the BERT - BiLSTM for sentence encoder uses BERT to compose a sentence 's wordpieces into word-level embeddings and subsequently applies BiLSTM to word -level representations .
Second , the biaffine attention decoder determines the scores for an edge 's existence and its labels based on biaffine attention functions between roledependent representations .
We also present multi-level biaffine attention models by combining all the role-dependent representations that appear at multiple intermediate layers .
Introduction Recent studies on meaning representation parsing ( MRP ) have focused on different semantic graph frameworks such as bilexical semantic dependency graphs ( Peng et al. , 2017 ; Wang et al. , 2018 ; Dozat and Manning , 2018 ) , universal conceptual cognitive annotation ( Hershcovich et al. , 2017 ( Hershcovich et al. , , 2018 , and abstract meaning representation ( Wang and Xue ; Guo and Lu ; Song et al. , 2019 ; . To jointly address various semantic graphs , the aim of the Cross- Framework MRP task ( MRP 2019 ) at the 2019 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning ( CoNLL ) is to develop semantic graph parsing across the following five frameworks : 1 ) DM : DELPH -IN MRS Bi-Lexical Dependencies ( Ivanova et al. , 2012 ) , 2 ) PSD : Prague Semantic Dependencies ( Haji ?
et al. , 2012 ; , 3 ) EDS : Elementary Dependency Structures ( Oepen and L?nning , 2006 ) , 4 ) UCCA : Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation ( Abend and Rappoport , 2013 ) , and 5 ) AMR : Abstract Meaning Representation ( Banarescu et al. , 2013 ) .
One of the main aims of MRP 2019 is to indduce a unified parsing model for different semantic frameworks such that parsing models can be trained using multi-task learning or transfer learning .
To enable multi-task learning , we explicitly make shared common components in a neural network architecture across different frameworks .
For MRP 2019 , we propose a unified neural model for the DM / PSD / UCCA frameworks based on the biaffine attention used in Manning , 2017 , 2018 ; by deploying the sentence encoder part as a " shared " component across these three frameworks .
Our system consists of two main components : 1 . BERT -BiLSTM sentence encoder ( shared across frameworks ) :
Given a sentence , the BERT encoder ( Devlin et al. , 2019 ) encodes to its wordpieces and the encoded word piece-level represenations are composed into word-level embeddings based on BiLSTM .
Another BiLSTM layer is then applied to the resulting word - level embeddings to create the final sentence representations .
We refer to this neural layer for encoding sentences as the BERT - BiLSTM sentence encoder .
For multitask learning , the BERT - BiLSTM sentence encoder is shared across all target frameworks .
2 . Biaffine attention decoder ( frameworkspecific ) :
Role-dependent representations for each word are first induced from the sentence - level embeddings of the BERT - BiLSTM encoder using simple feed -forward layers .
Biaffine attention is then performed on the resulting role-dependent representations to predict the existence of an edge and its labels .
However , the biaffine attention decoder is not shared but separately trained for each framework .
Thus , we have three different biaffine decoders corresponding to DM , PSD , and UCCA .
In addition , our system handles the following specific issues for UCCA parsing and node property prediction : 1 . UCCA parsing using biaffine attention
To handle UCCA formats using a biaffine attention model , we convert a UCCA graph to a bilexical framework using the semstr tool , which is based on the head rules of UCCA in ( Hershcovich et al. , 2017 ) .
1 After the biaffine attention is performed , the parsed bilexical graph is converted back to the UCCA format .
2 . BiLSTM neural models for node property prediction :
In addition to predicting the existence and labels of an edge , the system is required to predict node properties ( for DM and PSD ) .
To handle node properties , we further develop property -specific BiLSTMbased neural models .
2
These propertyspecific neural components are designed in a framework -specific manner and are not shared across frameworks .
Furthermore , we present multi-level biaffine attention models , motivated by the multi-level architecture of FusionNet in the machine reading comprehension task .
The preliminary unofficial experiments using our own development seting show that multi-task learning is helpful in improving UCCA 's performance , but it does not lead to improvement in performances on the DM and PSD frameworks .
We first converted a UCCA MRP format to its xml format and then applied the converter ( semstr / convert.py ) in semstr to obtain its CoNLL format : https://github.com/danielhers/semstr
2
The node properties required for DM and PSD are a POS tag and a frame .
We prepared a BiLSTM neural model for predicting the frame information of a node only , whereas we used the companion data of MRP 2019 to predict POS tags .
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows :
Section 2 presents our system architecture with details , Section 3 describes the detailed process for training biaffine attention models .
Section 4 and 5 provide the preliminary experiment results and the official results at MRP 2019 , respectively , and our concluding remarks and a description of future work are given in Section 6 .
Model Figure 1 shows the neural architecture based on biaffine attention for bilexical semantic dependency parsing .
The neural architecture consists of two components : 1 ) the BERT - BiLSTM encoder and 2 ) the biaffine attention decoder .
1 ) In BERT - BiLSTM encoder , an input sentence is fed to a word representation layer using BERT , resulting in a sequence of word embedding vectors , which are then given to the BiLSTM layer to produce a sentence representation .
2 ) In biaffine attention , additional feed -forward layers are applied to obtain role-dependent representations for head and dependent roles , which are then forwarded to the biaffine attention .
Encoder : BERT -BiLSTM
Word representation layer using BERT
The word representation using BERT uses BiL-STM for composing to word-level embeddings from wordpiece - level embeddings , similar to , which used the average pooling for composition .
Specifically , suppose that an input sentence consists of n words , i.e. , x 1 ? ? ? x n .
To obtain the word representation x i for x i , we use BERT from ( Devlin et al. , 2019 ) pieces and they are fed to the BERT encoder .
The resulting output from BERT , which consists of the word pieces in the i-th word are aggregated using BiLSTM , producing w bert i , named BERT wordlevel embedding .
3
The BERT word- level embedding is further combined with the pretrained GloVe word embedding of ( Pennington et al. , 2014 ) and part-ofspeech ( POS ) tag embedding to produce the final word representation , as follows : x i = w bert i ; e glove i ; e P OS i where e glove i and e P OS i denote the pretrained GloVe word embedding and the POS tag embedding for the i-th word , respectively .
BiLSTM sentence encoding layer Once word representations are obtained , we further apply BiLSTM to x 1 ? ? ?
x n to obtain the following initial hidden representation of the i-th word : r i = BiLST M i ( x 1 ? ? ? x n ) where BiLST M i refers to the i-th hidden representation obtained by applying BiLSTM to a given sequence .
Decoder : Biaffine attention
To formulate a decoder using biaffine attention , let BiAf f ( x , y ) be a biaffine function using the notations of ( Dozat and Manning , 2018 ) and ( Socher et al. , 2013 ) as follows : BiAf f m ( x , y ) = x T U [ 1 :m ] y + V x y + b where U [ 1:k ] ? R d?d? m is a tensor , x T U [ 1 :m ] y produces vector r ?
R k , V ? R m?d is a matrix and b ?
R m is a vector for the bias term .
Our biaffine attention decoder is similar to that of ( Dozat and Manning , 2018 ) and is formulated as follows : F F N ( x ) = f ( Ax + b ) h ( head ) i = F F N ( head ) ( r i ) h ( dep ) i = F F N ( dep ) ( r i ) h ( l- head ) i = F F N ( l-head ) ( r i ) h ( l- dep ) i = F F N ( l- dep ) ( r i ) s ( edge ) i , j = BiAf f ( edge ) 1 h ( dep ) i , h ( head ) j s ( label ) i , j = BiAf f ( label ) k h ( l- dep ) i , h ( l- head ) j s ( top ) i = F F N ( top ) ( r i ) ( 1 ) where k is the number of node labels , and f is the activation function used in the feed-forward layer F F N . 4 In contrast to the setting of ( Dozat and Manning , 2018 ) , the top score s ( top ) i is newly introduced in our model , where we exploit a simple feed -forward layer for predicting top nodes instead of using an attention method .
Using the score functions of Eq. ( 1 ) , the prediction results for arcs , labels , and top nodes are formulated as follows : y ( edge ) i , j = I s edge i , j ? 0 y ( label ) i , j = argmax s ( label ) i , j y ( top ) i = I s ( top ) i ? 0 ( 2 ) where I( expr ) is an indicator function which gives 1 if expr is true and 0 otherwise .
Multi-level Biaffine attention
We also investigated a multi-level biaffine attention , whose information flow is described in , respectively .
more abstract high- level representation .
In the task of semantic graph parsing , predicting an arc and a label may be resolved not just by single - level representation but by the combination of various levels of representations ;
For example , predicting an arc between two deep semantic subgraphs ( with high depths ) may require more abstract representations for those graphs than the case of predicting an arc between two shallow semantic subgraphs ( with low depths ) .
The multi-level biaffine attention is based on the fusion of all the role-dependent representations across levels .
5
This type of multi-level attention is different from deep biaffine attention of ( Dozat and Manning , 2018 ) , which uses only single roledependent hidden representation at the final level .
To formulate the multi-level biaffine attention , we first apply deep BiLSTM encoder of L-levels to a list of word embeddings x 1 , ? ? ? , x n as follows .
r i,0 = x i r i , l = BiLST M i ( r 1,l?1 ? ? ? r n,l?1 ) where r i ,l is the hidden representation of the BiL-STM at the l-th layer .
The role-dependent representation for each l-th layer is formulated as follows : h ( head ) i , l = F F N ( head ) ( r i , l ) h ( dep ) i , l = F F N ( dep ) ( r i , l ) 5 A pair of syntactic roles in role-dependent representations are considered - head- dependent roles ( or predicateargument roles ) .
To aggregate all the role-dependent representations , we use the fusion function , denoted as o = f usion ( x , y ) , as defined in ( Hu et al. , 2018 ) : x = gleu ( W r [ x ; y ; x y ; x ? y ] ) g = ?
( W g [ x ; y ; x y ; x ? y ] ) o = g x + ( 1 ? g ) x where is element -wise multiplication .
For notational simplicity , we further define sf u(x , y , z ) , the fusion function that takes three arguments , as follows : sf u ( x , y , z ) = f usion ( f usion ( x , y ) , z) Applying the sf u function results in the compositional role-dependent representations z z ( head ) i = sf u ( head ) h ( head ) i,1 , h ( head ) i,2 , h ( head ) i,3 z ( dep ) i = sf u ( dep ) h ( dep ) i,1 , h ( dep ) i,2 , h ( dep ) i,3 s ( edge ) i , j = BiAf f ( edge ) 1 z ( dep ) i , z ( head ) j ( 3 ) Similar to the arc scores in Eq. ( 3 ) , we straightforwardly define multi-level terms related to label scores such as h ( l- dep ) i , k , h ( l- head ) i , k , z ( l- head ) i , and z ( l- dep ) i .
Property prediction based on BiLSTM
To predict frame information , which is one of the node properties in DM and PSD , we use a simple BiLSTM architecture with a single output layer that generates a node property for each word .
6 Different from the biaffine attention model , the property predictor does not use BERT but a simple word representation that consists of the pretrained GloVe and the POS tag embedding as follows : x ( prop ) i = e glove i ; e P OS i For encoding a sentence , another BiLSTM is then applied to the sequence of word representations , as follows : r ( prop ) i = BiLST M ( prop ) i ( x 1 ? ? ? x n )
The output layer uses the following simple affine transformation : s ( prop ) i = F F N ( prop ) r ( prop ) i ( 4 )
The loss function uses the cross entropy , which is formulated given a single training sentence as follows : L ( prop ) = i log sof tmax g ( i ) s ( prop ) i ( 5 ) where g ( i ) is the gold property value of the i-th word and sof tmax k is the function of k-th element of softmax values .
7 3 Training
Preprocessing
We use word tokens and their POS tags in the companion dataset provided by MRP 2019 .
To perform UCCA parsing using biaffine attention , conversion between UCCA and bilexical formats is required .
For the conversion , we use the semstr tool , which is based on the head rules defined in ( Hershcovich et al. , 2017 ) .
Multi-task learning on a single framework
In each semantic graph framework , the biaffine attention models consist of three subtasks - edge detection , edge labeling , and top node prediction .
We jointly train the neural components of all the subtasks for each framework in the multi-task learning setting using the following combined loss function : L = ? 1 L ( edge ) + ? 2 L ( label ) + ? 3 L ( top ) ( 6 ) where L ( edge ) , L ( label ) , and L ( top ) are the loss functions for edge detection , edge labeling , and top node prediction , respectively , and ?
i is the weight for each loss function .
However , the property predictor of Section 2.4 is not jointly trained on a single framework because its neural components can be shared in any component in the biaffine attention models .
Multi-task learning across frameworks
To enable multi-task learning across frameworks , we share the BERT - BiLSTM encoder as a common neural component across three frameworks and use framework -specific models for the biaffine attention decoder .
Our approach to multi-task learning is similar to that of SHARED1 of ( Peng et al. , 2017 ) .
In multi-task learning , we alternate training examples for each framework using the frameworkspecific loss function of Eq. ( 6 ) such that , over each epoch , all the training examples across the three frameworks are fairly fed without bias to a specific framework .
Hyperparameters
We used Adam optimizer ( Kingma and Ba , 2015 ) to train our biaffine attention models .
In this section , we present the preliminary experimental results , which compare variants of our models .
To perform the preliminary experiment , we randomly split the MRP 2019 dataset into training and development sets .
Table 2 shows the statistics of training and development sets for the three frameworks .
The evaluation measures are unlabeled dependency F1 scores ( UF ) , labeled dependency F1 scores ( LF ) , and top node prediction accuracy ( Top ) .
We report the evaluation metrics for the development sets .
Experimental results
We evaluated the following four biaffine attention methods : 1 . Biaffine :
This model is the baseline biaffine attention model based on the BiLSTM sentence encoder without using BERT .
2 . BERT + Biaffine :
This model uses the BERT - BiLSTM encoder of Section 2.1 and the biaffine attention model of Section 2.2 .
3 . BERT + Multi-level Biaffine :
This model uses BERT - BiLSTM encoder of Section 2.1 and uses the multi-level attention method of Section 2.3 .
BERT + Biaffine + MTL : This model is the same as BERT + Biaffine but uses the multitask learning across frameworks described in Section 3.3 .
Table 3 shows the UF , LF , and Top on the three semantic graph frameworks , comparing the four variants of biaffine attention models .
BERT + Biaffine performs better than Biaffine , in particular , obtaining the increases of about 5 % for UF and LF on the UCCA framework .
However , BERT + Multi-level Biaffine does not achieve any further improvements with respect to Biaffine , often yielding weak performances similar to that of the BERT - Biaffine model on the PSD and UCCA frameworks .
BERT + Biaffine + MTL only achieves small improvements on UCCA framework whereas no improvements on DM and PSD frameworks can be observed .
A statistically insignificant improvement for multi-task learning in BERT + Biaffine + MTL was similarly reported in the results of SHARED1 in ( Peng et al. , 2017 ) .
These results imply that instead of naively using the shared encoder only , other advanced multi-task learning approaches such as placing task -specific encoding , as detailed in ( Peng et al. , 2017 ) , need to be considered .
Official Results
Given the preliminary results , we chose the basic biaffine model " BERT + Biaffine " of Table 3 for the final submission to MRP 2019 .
The official results using BERT + Biaffine are summarized in Tables 4 and 5 , which compare the results of ERG ( Oepen and Flickinger , 2019 ) and TUPA ( Hershcovich and Arviv , 2019 ) which were provided by the task organizer .
Table 4 shows the performances of the MRP metrics on the three frameworks , whereas Table 5 presents the performances of task -specific metrics using the SDM metrics and UCCA metric .
The SDM metrics use the unlabeled dependency precision / recall / F1 ( UP / UR / UF ) , the labeled dependency precision / recall / F1 ( LP / LR / LF ) , and the unlabeled / labeled exact matches ( UM / LM ) .
The UCCA metrics use the unlabeled and labeled arc precision / recall / F1 for primary , remote and all types of arcs .
8 Overall , our system shows better performances over the baseline TUPA 's system , except for the results of UCCA metrics .
Comparing to ERG which is the top-performing system in MRP metric on DM , our biaffine system shows slightly improved performance over ERG in terms of UF of the SDP metric .
Comparing to the published MRP metrics of the best system ( i.e. MRP all metric ) , the performances of our system are about 1 .
Summary and Conclusion
In this paper , we presented the Jeonbuk National University 's system based on unified biaffine attention models for DM , PSD , and UCCA frameworks for the MRP 2019 task .
We investigated the extensions of the original biaffine models using multi-level biaffine attention and multi-task learning .
The preliminary experiment results show that the use of multi-level models and multi-task learning had no effect on MRP performances under our current settings .
The statistically insignificant results of multi-task learning imply that there may be some necessary conditions beyond the default setting to meet before multi-task learning with parameter sharing is effective .
In this direction , we plan to explore why multi-task learning is not effective in our current experiment , try to postulate reasonable hypothesis that will help clarifying the effect of multi-task learning , and further examine other advanced multi-task learning including the approaches of ( Peng et al. , 2017 ) .
In addition , we would like to examine alternative fusion functions for multi-level affine attention .

This aggregation is similar to the BiLSTM - based composition in ( Ballesteros et al. , 2015 ; Na et al. , 2018 ) which uses characters as subtokens , whereas our aggregation uses word pieces as subtokens .
In our submission , we used the identity function for f .
Here , words ( or tokens ) correspond to nodes in a semantic graph .
We allow a NULL value to be a gold property value .
Given this setting , the values of g ( i ) are mostly NULL in the frame property of PSD .
Our system ranked fifth for framework -specific LF on DM and PSD , ranked eighth on UCCA , first for frameworkspecific UF using the 100- sentence LPPS sub-set , and second for LF on the PSD framework .
