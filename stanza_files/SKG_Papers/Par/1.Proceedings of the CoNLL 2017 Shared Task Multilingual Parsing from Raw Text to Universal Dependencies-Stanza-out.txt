Introduction
This volume contains papers describing systems submitted to the CoNLL 2017 Shared Task : Multilingual Parsing from Raw Text to Universal Dependencies and an overview paper summarizing the task , its features , evaluation methodology for the main and additional metrics , and some interesting observations about the submitted systems and the task as a whole .
This Shared Task ( http://universaldependencies.org/conll17/) can be seen as an extension of the CoNLL 2007 Shared Task on parsing , but there are many important differences that make this year 's task unique with several " firsts " .
Most importantly , the data for this task come from the Universal Dependencies project ( http://universaldependencies.org), which provides annotated treebanks for a large number of languages using the same annotation scheme for all of them .
In the shared task setting , this allows for more meaningful comparison between systems as well as languages , since differences are much more likely due to true parser differences rather than differences caused by annotation schemes .
In addition , the number of languages for which training data were available is unprecedented for a single shared task : a total of 64 treebanks in 45 languages have been provided for training the systems .
Additional data have been provided too , as were some baseline systems for those who wanted to try only some particular aspect of parsing .
Overall , the task can be described as " closed " , since only pre-approved data could be used .
For evaluation , there were 81 datasets ( standard datasets for the treebank languages provided for training , plus more test sets in known languages , but based on a specially created and annotated parallel corpus , and four surprise language test sets ) .
Participants had to process all the test sets .
The TIRA platform has been used for evaluation , as was the case already for the CoNLL 2015 and 2016 Shared Tasks , meaning that participants had to provide their code on a designated virtual machine to be run by the organizers to produce official results .
However , test data have been published after the official evaluation period , and participants could run their systems at home to produce additional results they were allowed to include in the system description papers .
There was one main evaluation metric - Labeled Attachment Score - for the main ranking table evaluating dependency parsing performance , plus additional metrics for tokenization , word and sentence segmentation , POS tagging , lemmatization and disambiguation of morphological features , and separate metrics computed for interesting subsets of the evaluation data .
A total of 32 systems ran successfully and have been ranked ( http://universaldependencies .
org/conll17/results.html ) .
While there are clear overall winners , we would like to thank all participants for working hard on their submissions and adapting their systems not only to the datasets available , but also to the evaluation platform .
We would like to thank all of them for their effort , since it is the participants who are the core of any shared task 's success .
