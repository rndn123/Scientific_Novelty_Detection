In Conclusion Not Repetition : Comprehensive Abstractive Summarization With Diversified Attention Based On Determinantal Point Processes
abstract
Various Seq2Seq learning models designed for machine translation were applied for abstractive summarization task recently .
Despite these models provide high ROUGE scores , they are limited to generate comprehensive summaries with a high level of abstraction due to its degenerated attention distribution .
We introduce Diverse Convolutional Seq2Seq Model ( DivCNN Seq2Seq ) using Determinantal Point Processes methods ( Micro DPPs and Macro DPPs ) to produce attention distribution considering both quality and diversity .
Without breaking the end to end architecture , Di-vCNN Seq2Seq achieves a higher level of comprehensiveness compared to vanilla models and strong baselines .
All the reproducible codes and datasets are available online 1 .
Introduction Given an article , abstractive summarization aims at generating one or several short sentences that cover the main idea of original article , which is a combination of Natural Language Understanding ( NLU ) and Natural Language Generation ( NLG ) .
Abstractive summarization uses Seq2Seq models ( Sutskever et al. , 2014 ) which consist of an encoder , a decoder and attention mechanism ( Mnih et al. , 2014 ) .
With attention mechanism the decoder can choose a weighted context representation at each generation step so it can focus on different parts of encoded information .
Seq2Seq with attention achieved remarkable results on machine translation ( Bahdanau et al. , 2014 ) and other text generation tasks such as abstractive summarizaiton ( Rush et al. , 2015 ) .
Unlike machine translation that emphasizes attention mechanism as a method of learning word level alignments between source text and target Article : marseille , france the french prosecutor leading an investigation into the crash of germanwings flight 9525 insisted wednesday that he was not aware of any video footage from on board the plane . marseille prosecutor brice robin told cnn that so far no videos were used in the crash investigation ...... of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board germanwings flight 9525 as it crashed into the french alps . ...... paris match and bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site . ...... cnn 's frederik pleitgen , pamela boykoff , antonia mortensen , sandrine amiel and anna-maja rappard contributed to this report .

Many works noticed that attention may be over concentrated for summarization and hence cause problems like generating duplicate words or duplicate sentences .
Researchers try to solve these problems by introducing various attention structures , including local attention ( Luong et al. , 2015 ) , hierarchical attention ( Nallapati et al. , 2016 ) , distraction attention ( Chen et al. , 2016 ) and coverage mechanism ( See et al. , 2017 ) etc .
But all these works ignore another repeat problem , as we call it , " Original Text Repetition " .
We define and explain this problem in section 3 . In this paper we propose a novel Diverse Convolutional Seq2Seq Model ( DivCNN Seq2Seq ) based on Micro Determinantal Point Processes ( Micro DPPs ) and Macro Determinantal Point Processes ( Macro DPPs ) .
Our contributions are as fol-lows : ?
We define and describe the Original Text Repetition problem in abstractive summarization and identify the cause behind it , which are degenerated attention distributions .
We have also introduced three article-related metrics for the Original Text Repetition estimation and applied them in our experiments . ?
We suggest a solution to this problem in the form of introducing DPPs into deep neural network ( DNN ) attention adjustment and propose DivCNN Seq2Seq .
In order to adapt DPPs to large scale computing , we propose two kinds of methods : Micro DPPs and Macro DPPs .
To the best of our knowledge , this is the first attempt to adjust attention distributions considering both quality and diversity . ?
We evaluate our models on six open datasets and show its superiority on improving the comprehensiveness of generated summaries without losing much training and inference speed .
Convolutional Seq2Seq Learning Usually encoder and decoder in Seq2Seq architecture are recurrent neural network ( RNN ) or its variants like Long Short Term Memory ( LSTM ) ( Hochreiter and Schmidhuber , 1997 ) and Gated Recurrent Unit ( GRU ) ( Chung et al. , 2014 ) network .
Recently , a Seq2Seq architecture based entirely on convolutional neural networks ( CNN Seq2Seq ) ( Gehring et al. , 2017 ) was proposed .
It has better hierarchical representation of natural language and can be computed in parallel .
In this paper we choose CNN Seq2Seq as our baseline system because it performs better on capturing long -term dependency , which is important for summarization .
Both encoder and decoder in CNN Seq2Seq consist of convolutional blocks .
Each block contains a one dimensional convolution ( Conv1d ) , a gated linear unit ( GLU ) and several fully connected layers for dimension transformation .
Residual connection ( He et al. , 2016 ) and batch normalization ( Ioffe and Szegedy , 2015 ) are used in each block .
Each block receives an input I of size R B * T * C , where B , T , and C are respectively batch size , length of text and number of channels ( the same as embedding size ) .
Conv1d pads the sentence first and then generates a tensor [ O 1 , O 2 ] of size R B * T * 2C , doubling the channel .
The extra channels are used in a simple nonlinearity gated mechanism : O 1 , O 2 = Conv1d ( I ) ( 1 ) GLU ( [ O 1 , O 2 ] ) = O 1 ? ?( O 2 ) ( 2 ) Multi-step attention ( Gehring et al. , 2017 ) are used in CNN Seq2Seq .
Each convolutional block in decoder has its own attentive context .
Followed on query-key-value definition of attention , queries Q ? R B * Tg * C are different decoder block outputs , where T g stands for summary length ; keys K ? R B * Ts * C are encoder last block outputs , where T s stands for article length ; values are sum of encoder input embeddings E ? R B * Ts * C and K .
Because of the parallel architecture , attention for all decoder time steps can be calculated at once .
Such architecture can speed up training and give convenience for our DPPs calculation .
Using the simplest dot product attention , all the calculations can be done with an efficient batch matrix multiplication ( BMM ) .
score attn = BM M ( Q , K ) ( 3 ) weight attn = Sof tmax ( score attn ) ( 4 ) context = BM M ( weight attn , K + E ) ( 5 )
Original Text Repetition Original Text Repetition ( OTR ) problem means that each sentence in generated summaries are repetitions of article sentences .
The abstractive summarization hence degenerates to extractive summarization .
The ROUGE metric can not detect this problem since it only measures the n-grams concurrence between generated summaries and gold summaries without taking articles into consideration .
The word repeat problem ( See et al. , 2017 ) or the lack of abstraction problem ( Kry?ci?ski et al. , 2018 ) can be seen as extreme condition or alternative description of OTR .
Behind this phenomenon is the degenerated attention distribution learned by model which we define as : ? Narrow Word Attention for each summary word , the attention distribution narrows to one word position in article .
?
Adjacent Sentence Attention for all words in each summary sentence , their positions of attention peaks are adjacent or semantically adjacent , which means that attended article parts have similar features .
As shown in the Figure 1 , sentence attention degenerates to several adjacent peaks on the repeated article positions .
Usually each sentence in gold summaries considers multiple article sentences and induct to one , not simply copying one article sentence .
The gap between generated summaries ( copy ) and gold summaries ( induce ) means that model just learned to find article sentences that has the maximum similarity to gold summaries not the relation between article facts and summaries .
Degenerated attention mechanism misleads the model .
Diverse Convolutional Seq2Seq Model
To prevent Seq2Seq model from attention degeneration , we introduce DPPs as a method of regularization in CNN Seq2Seq and propose DivCNN Seq2Seq .
Quality and Diversity Decomposition of Determinantal Point Processes DPPs have been widely used in recommender systems , information retrieval and extractive summarization systems .
It can generate subsets with both high quality and high diversity ( Kulesza and Taskar , 2011 ) .
Given a discrete , finite point process P and a ground set D , if for every A ?
D and a random subset Y drawn according to P , there is : P ( A ? Y ) = det ( K A ) ( 6 ) where K is a real symmetric matrix that indexed by the elements of D , then P is a determinantal point process and K is the marginal kernel of DPPs .
Marginal kernel merely gives marginal probability of one certain item to be selected in one particular sampling process , hence we use Lensemble ( Kulesza and Taskar , 2011 ) to model atomic probabilities for every possible instantiation of Y : K = L( L + I ) ?1 = I ? ( L + I ) ?1 ( 7 ) P L ( Y = Y ) ? det ( L Y ) ( 8 ) P L ( Y = Y ) = det ( L Y ) det ( L + I ) ( 9 ) L-ensemble is also one kind of DPPs and can be constructed directly using the quality ( q ) and similarity ( sim ) of point set : L i , j = q( i ) * sim ( i , j ) * q( j ) ( 10 ) Equation 9 is a probability that subset Y being chosen , which is actually a quantitative indicator for the score of the subset considering both its quality and diversity ( QD-score ) .
Summarization follows the same principle : a good summary should consider both information significance and redundancy .
In extractive summarization set of sentences with high score ( quality ) and diversity is chosen to a summary , using DPPs sampling algorithm ( Li et al. , 2017 ) .
In Figure 2 we show the difference between quality -only sampling and DPPs sampling .
We first generate a simulated attention distribution for testing .
Then we use word position distance as similarity measure and attention as quality to construct the L matrix ( L-ensemble ) for DPPs .
Point subset is sampled based on quality ( green ) or DPPs ( blue ) , then a gaussian mixture distribution was generated around these points to soften and reweight the attention .
Both samplings approximate the distribution of original attention distribution ( orange ) , but DPPs approximate it better and have more scattering peaks .
Sampling only considering attention weight ( quality ) generates less peaks , which means many adjacent points with low diversity are sampled .
In actual experiments we choose attention weight as quality .
The model learns attention distribution to score different parts of article and obviously higher attention means higher quality .
In original CNN Seq2Seq the sum of encoder output and encoder input embeddings are encoded feature vectors .
We follow this setting and use the feature vectors to calculate cosine similarity .
Specifically , the encoder output are tree-like semantic features extracted by CNN encoder while the encoder input embedding provides point information about a specific input element before encoding ( Gehring et al. , 2017 ) .
Hence feature vectors contain both highly abstract semantic features and specific grammatical features when calculating diversity .
Compared to extractive summarization , DPPs in abstractive summarization use status of DNN as quality and diversity which can be optimized dynamically during training .
The computation of L matrix is shown in Figure 3 .
For each sample in a batch ( 128 in our experiments ) , the encoder input embeddings E ? R Ts * C multiply its transpose to produce similarity matrix S ? R Ts * Ts .
The weight vectors of Multi-step Attention average over decoder layers and sum-mary length , then do the same operation to generate quality matrix Q ? R Ts * Ts .
Then we use the hadamard product of Q and S as L ? R Ts * Ts .
The idea of Macro DPPs is to pick subsets under some restriction and evaluate QD - score of subset using equation 9 .
The ideal attention distribution should have subsets with high QD - score .
Macro DPPs
We do not use DPPs sampling since the purpose of Macro DPPs is to evaluate subsets not to sample subsets with high QD -score .
The attention distribute over the ground set so we introduce conditional sampling to sample a subset that has high quality or high diversity , then improve the other metric as follows : ? Improve Diversity in High Quality Subset Select points with high attention weight to construct subset and require no gradient for quality matrix , just optimize diversity .
? Improve Quality in High Diversity Subset Sampling point subset with high diversity is hard to realize , so we just make equidistant ( equidistant on word positions ) sampling to approximate it .
Contrary to the previous method , we require no gradient for similarity matrix and just optimize quality .
We randomly choose one condition in each batch .
After the point subset was chosen , the submatrix L Y can be built by selecting elements in L indexed by point subset .
Then we calculate the QD - score of the submatrix and add it into model loss as a regularization .
We calculate the logarithmic summation of eigenvalues to prevent numeri-cal underflow .
loss QD = log ?
L+I ? log ? L Y ( 11 ) ? det( L Y ) det ( L + I ) ( 12 ) loss model = ?loss M LE + ( 1 ? ? ) loss QD ( 13 )
Micro DPPs
The idea of Micro DPPs is to sample a subset Y with large QD - score from all article positions and to use these sampled points as adjusted attention focus points .
Then a Gaussian Mixture ( GM ) distribution around these points is generated as ideal attention distribution ( weight ideal ) .
The whole process can be seen as a selection and softening on attention .
The Kullback - Leibler divergence of the ideal distribution and attention distribution ( weight ) then is added into the loss function as regularization .
P = BF GM Inf erence ( L , t ) ( 14 ) weight ideal = GM ?P ( ? , ? , ? ) ( 15 ) loss KL = KLdiv( weight ideal , weight attn ) ( 16 ) loss model = ?loss M LE + ( 1 ? ? ) loss KL ( 17 ) Classic sampling algorithm for DPPs ( Kulesza and Taskar , 2011 ) runs slow when the size of L matrix is large and it can not be computed in batch .
In the DivCNN Seq2Seq model we need to construct an L matrix for every sample and every layer in the decoder , which is ultimately large .
To optimize DPPs runtime for this large-scale computation , we introduce a Batch computation version of Fast Greedy Maximum A Posteriori Inference ( BFGMInference ) to sample a subset with high QD -score .
BFGMInference uses a greedy method to approximate the MAP result Y map = argmax Y ?D det ( L Y ) : each time we select j that has maximum QD - score improvements and add it to Y . f ( Y ) = log det ( L Y ( 18 ) j = argmax i?D\Y f ( Y ? { i} ) ? f ( Y ) ( 19 ) L Y = V V T ( 20 ) L Y ?{i} = V 0 c i d i V 0 c i d i T ( 21 ) V c T i = L Y , i ( 22 ) d 2 i = L ii ? || c i || 2 2 ( 23 )
Then we can transform equation 19 into : j = argmax i?D\Y log ( d 2 i ) ( 24 )
The c and d can be updated incrementally according to equation 22 and 23 .
The complete algorithm is described in Algorithm 1 . BFGMInference algorithm gains significant speed improvements when the size of L matrix is large as shown in Figure 5 .
Experimental Setup Datasets
We test DivCNN Seq2Seq model on the widely used CNN - DM dataset ( Hermann et al. , 2015 ) and give detailed analysis on diversity and quality .
Also we tried our model on other five abstractive summarization datasets which are NEWSROOM corpus ( Grusky et al. , 2018 ) , TLDR ( V?lske et al. , 2017 ) , BIGPATENT ( Sharma et al. , 2019 ) , WIK -IHOW ( Koupaee and Wang , 2018 ) and RED-DIT ( Kim et al. , 2018 ) 2 . Hyperparameters and Optimization
All the CNN models use a 50000 words article dictionary and 20000 words summary dictionary with byte pair encoding ( BPE ) ( Sennrich et al. , 2015 ) .
Word embeddings are pretrained on training corpus using Fasttext ( Bojanowski et al. , 2017 ; Joulin et al. , 2016 ) .
We do not train models with large parameters to increase ROUGE results since what we try to improve is the comprehensiveness of each sentence in summary .
The total parameters of whole CNN seq2seq Model are about 3800w and the DivCNN Seq2Seq does not change the parameters amount .
All the models set embedding dimensionality and CNN channels to 256 .
The encoder has 20 blocks with kernel size 5 and the decoder has 4 blocks with kernel size 3 .
Such scale of model parameters are enough for the model to generate fluent summaries .
The ? is 0.6 for Macro DPPs and 0.7 for Micro DPPs .
In Macro DPPs we choose top 30 points when optimizing diversity and a stride of 20 for equidistant .
In Micro DPPs for each summary we sample 20 points to generate gaussian mixture distributions .
We train the model with Nesterov 's accelerated gradient method using a momentum of 0.99 and renormalized gradients when the norm exceeded 0.1 ( Sutskever et al. , 2013 ) .
The beam search size is 5 and we apply a dropout of 0.1 to the embeddings and linear transform layers .
We did not fix training epoches .
The model was trained until the average epoch loss can not be lower anymore .
The DPPs regularization only works when training and does not bring extra parameters into model .
During test the model has learned proper attention so the generation is the same as vanilla CNN Seq2Seq Model .
Article -Related Metrics
It is hard to evaluate a summary since summarization itself is very subjective .
ROUGE compares generated summaries and gold summaries in checking concurrence of n-grams that results in a very limited evaluation in a word level .
We set three article-related metrics to evaluate the comprehensiveness of summaries : ? Jaccard Similarity Upper Bound ( JS )
For each summary sentence , we compute its jaccard similarity with every article sentence .
The largest jaccard similarity for each summary sentence is selected as JS .
It measures the extent to which summaries copy articles .
The worst situation is 1 . ? Sentence Coverage ( SC )
We define those article sentences that have a jaccard similarity higher than the gold summaries JS value as covered sentence .
Then the average counts of covered article sentences for each summary sentence is a ratio that can be used to measure the coverage of the article by the summaries .
The worst situation is less than or equal to 1 . ? Novel Bigram Proportion ( NOVEL )
The percentage of bigrams in summaries that did not appear in the article .
It reflects the abstraction of summaries .
The worst situation is 0 .
Strong Baseline
We chose four strong baselines which reported high ROUGE scores .
Bot-tomUp ( Gehrmann et al. , 2018 ) , sumGAN and RL Rerank ( Chen and Bansal , 2018 ) are complicate systems that have additional modules or post-processings and partially relieved the OTR problem .
The Pointer Generator ( See et al. , 2017 ) reaches best ROUGE result in single end to end model but suffers greatly from repetition problem .
Various Possible Causes of the OTR problem
We had supposed several other reasons for the repetition problems besides attention degeneration including overfitting , bad usage of translation -style attention mechanism , lack of decoding ability and high variance attention distribution .
Respectively , we designed comparative experiments as follows : ? Overfitting
We set dropout ratio to 0.1 ( SMALL ) and 0.5 ( LARGE ) for testing overfitting .
?
Direct Attention
Remove the encoder input embedding in attention value so the decoder looks at highly abstract features directly ( DI - RECT ) .
?
Lack of Decoding Ability
We double ( DOU - BLE ) or half ( HALF ) the vanilla ( VANILLA ) decoder layers to adjust the decoding ability .
?
High Variance Attention
We scale down the attention distribution manually when trainning ( SCALE ) , lowering the variance of the distribution .
Results Various Possibilities
As shown in Table 4 , scaled attention has the lowest jaccard similarity upper bound , which confirms our idea that overconcentrated attention makes model to copy article sentences .
As for sentence coverage , small decoder with large drop out ratio performs the best , proving that large and overfitted models may have degenerated attention .
Although the scaled attention has the best JS score , its SC score is the worst ( SC less than 1.0 means duplicate sentences are generated ) .
So , we may conclude that directly scaling down attention breaks the value of attention .
The ideal attention is not about erasing the peak or the variance of attention but to have multiple peaks in sentence attention and have high diversity at the same time .
Neither aggregative nor scattering attention distributions do good to summary generation .
Direct attention model has the maximum NOVEL score which means point information about a specific input element makes model prefer copying article words instead of generating new words .
CNN -DM Results
With large model parameters and dictionaries , four models in strong baselines reach nearly 40 points in ROUGE - 1 but they perform poorly on article-related metrics .
Single end to end systems like Pointer Generator performs poorly on JS value and NOVEL proportion which means most of its summaries are copied from articles .
As for three models with multiple modules or post-processing , the BottomUp model has relatively good jaccard similarity upper bound and the best ROUGE result but its articlerelated metrics are still far away from gold summaries level .
RL Rerank model has better score on JS and sumGAN has better NOVEL score but none of these model reached a balanced good performance on three article -related metrics .
Compared to vanilla CNN Seq2Seq , DivCNN Seq2Seq improves the JS and NOVEL points and raises the ROUGE score at the same time , proving that proper attention distribution can help reaching a better local optima .
Compared with strong baselines , DivCNN Seq2Seq achieves the best in NOVEL , second and third in JS and SC , respectively .
Empirically we suggest that ? for both Micro and Macro DPPs should be set to make average loss change less than 10 % compared to vanilla models .
We also observed that Micro DPPs is more sensitive to ? compared to Macro DPPs and is easier to converge but may degenerate to vanilla CNN Seq2Seq .
Macro DPPs usually can reach better results but it needs more time to train since eigenvalue calculation is expensive and can not be accelerated through fp16 tensor computing .
Novel Bigram NOVEL is a tricky metric which is used in many researches about abstractive summarization .
There are many possibilities on explaining a high NOVEL score : first , the summary get a high Novel Bigram ratio because it has many Novel unigrams , which may be good or bad ; second , the model may be underfitting and can Extractive Summarization based on Learned Attention
We also extract article sentences based on sentence attention learned by DPPs models to generate summaries .
The attention of a sentence is the sum of the attention weights of the words in the sentence .
5 shows that DivCNN performs better than best baselines on NEWSROOM , REDDIT and reaches incredible ROUGE scores more than 60 ( but no baseline is reported in the dataset paper so the result is not comparable ) .
The compression ratio and article length have little impact on the performance of DivCNN .
The results show that Di-vCNN prefers short summaries .
Model Attention & Representation Degeneration
In order to solve attention degeneration we introduce DPPs to improve the diversity of features where model paid high attention to .
This solution is consistent with the Presentation Degeneration Problem in NLG ( Gao et al. , 2018 ) .
As shown in Figure 7 , Macro DPPs have more diverse embedding presentation compared to vanilla model .
( Gao et al. , 2018 ) directly add a regularization loss of diversity to increase the representation power of word embeddings while we aim at generating attention
Conclusions and Future Works
We have defined the " OTR " problem that leads to incomplete summaries and revealed the cause behind it , which is attention degeneration .
We also introduce three article-related metrics to evaluate this problem .
DPPs are applied directly on attention generation and we propose Macro and Micro DPPs versions of DivCNN Seq2Seq model to adjust attention considering both quality and diversity .
Results on CNN - DM and other five open datasets show that DivCNN Seq2Seq can improve the comprehensiveness of summaries .
Due to the hardware limitation we only train a small - parameters version of DivCNN .
Also we lost some precision when approximating L matrix and accelerating sampling .
These drawbacks lead to limited performance improvements .
In the future we hope to explore further on following directions : Quantifiable and controllable quality / diversity in DPPs ; better approximation in conditional sampling , such as dynamic sampling stride adjustment ; try to apply DPPs -optimized attention on another student model to improve generation .

The generated summary repeats the first sentence in article .
We select the first 16 words of summary and show their attention over first 50 words of article .

DPPs sampling reweighting approximates original distribution better since it catches the high attention area around position 160 .
It also samples less adjacent points around position 110 .

Good summaries model learned have styles differ from human-write summaries .
Model tend to copy bigrams from original article and reorganize them into short summary sentences .
Human tend to use brand new bigrams to paraphrase facts contained in original article .
The model use a rewrite ( compress and extract ) way while human-write is overwrite style .
not generate fluent sentences ; third , the generated summary use novel bigrams to conclude the orig- inal text and generate readable sentences , which is the best condition .
From the table 3 we can see that Bottom Up has the best ROUGE and JS results but worst NOVEL score .
Our DivCNN
Models have just the opposite metric scores .
These three metrics should n't be ambivalent since gold sum - maries can reach high NOVEL and low JS at the same time .
Base on these facts we make the fol - lowing conjectures : ? ?
Though we use human-write summaries as gold summaries for model to learn and the MLE loss is steadily descending during training but it learned summaries with different style .
It implicates that model may not have a " NLU + NLG " process like human do but be restrained in a sentence - level rewrite framework .
For Bottom Up and RL Rerank it is not a problem because these two systems are designed to rewrite .
They only send parts of article into Seq2Seq .
Such design can gain high ROUGE score but it is not the way in which human write gold summaries .
Table 5 : 5 Table 3 shows that extractive summarization reaches better ROUGE values , implicating that both vanilla and DivCNN models learned appropriate sentence attention .
Extractive summarization uses accumulated sentence attention instead of specific distribution , so the results of vanilla models are almost the same as DivCNN .

As shown in Figure 6 , vanilla model ( red ) learned only several peaks over article position 70 to 90 , which suggests that it only focuses on one sentence and repeats this sentence in a summary .
Attention learned by Micro DPPs model ( green ) still narrows to several peaks but explores more positions compared to vanilla .
Macro DPPs ( blue ) has more natural design of loss function and it optimize quality and diversity directly so it has a more scattering attention distribution .
More Datasets
We test our model on other five newly - released abstractive summarization datasets which have various compression ratio , different professional field and more flexible human-write summaries .
Only ROUGE results are collected since no baseline generated summaries are provided for us to calculate article -related metrics .
