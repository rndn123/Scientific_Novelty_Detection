SUPERT : Towards New Frontiers in Unsupervised Evaluation Metrics for Multi-Document Summarization
abstract
We study unsupervised multi-document summarization evaluation metrics , which require neither human-written reference summaries nor human annotations ( e.g. preferences , ratings , etc. ) .
We propose SUPERT , which rates the quality of a summary by measuring its semantic similarity with a pseudo reference summary , i.e. selected salient sentences from the source documents , using contextualized embeddings and soft token alignment techniques .
Compared to the state- of- theart unsupervised evaluation metrics , SUPERT correlates better with human ratings by 18- 39 % .
Furthermore , we use SUPERT as rewards to guide a neural - based reinforcement learning summarizer , yielding favorable performance compared to the state - of - the - art unsupervised summarizers .

Introduction
Evaluating the quality of machine - generated summaries is a highly laborious and hence expensive task .
Most existing evaluation methods require certain forms of human involvement , thus are supervised : they either directly let humans rate the generated summaries ( e.g. Pyramid ( Nenkova and Passonneau , 2004 ) ) , elicit human-written reference summaries and measure their overlap with the generated summaries ( e.g. using ROGUE ( Lin , 2004a ) or MoverScore ( Zhao et al. , 2019 ) ) , or collect some human annotations ( e.g. preferences over pairs of summaries ( Gao et al. , 2019a ) ) to learn a summary evaluation function .
Evaluation in multidocument summarization is particularly expensive : Lin ( 2004 b ) reports that it requires 3,000 hours of human effort to evaluate the summaries from the Document Understanding Conferences ( DUC ) 1 .
To reduce the expenses for evaluating multidocument summaries , we investigate unsupervised evaluation methods , which require neither human annotations nor reference summaries .
In particular , we focus on evaluating the relevance ( Peyrard , 2019 ) of multi-document summaries , i.e. measuring how much salient information from the source documents is covered by the summaries .
There exist a few unsupervised evaluation methods ( Louis and Nenkova , 2013 ; Sun and Nenkova , 2019 ) , but they have low correlation with human relevance ratings at summary level : given multiple summaries for the same source documents , these methods can hardly distinguish summaries with high relevance from those with low relevance ( see ?3 ) .
Contributions .
First , to better measure the semantic overlap between source documents and machine - generated summaries , we propose to use state - of - the - art contextualized text encoders , e.g. BERT ( Devlin et al. , 2019 ) and its variant Sentence - BERT ( SBERT ) ( Reimers and Gurevych , 2019 ) , which is optimized for measuring semantic similarity between sentences , to develop unsupervised evaluation methods .
We measure the relevance of a summary in two steps : ( i ) identifying the salient information in the input documents , to build a pseudo reference summary , and ( ii ) measuring the semantic overlap between the pseudo reference and the summary to be evaluated .
The resulting evaluation method is called SUPERT ( SUmmarization evaluation with Pseudo references and bERT ) .
Fig. 1 illustrates the major steps of SUPERT .
We show that compared to state - of - the - art unsupervised metrics , the best SUPERT correlates better with the human ratings by 18- 39 % ( in Kendall 's ? ) .
Second , we use SUPERT as reward functions to guide Reinforcement Learning ( RL ) based extractive summarizers .
We show it outperforms the state - of - the - art unsupervised summarization methods ( in multiple ROUGE metrics ) .
Related Work Reference - based Evaluation .
Popular metrics like ROUGE ( Lin , 2004a ) , BLEU ( Papineni et al. , 2002 ) and METEOR ( Lavie and Denkowski , 2009 ) fall into this category .
They require ( preferably , multiple ) human written references and measure the relevance of a summary by comparing its overlapping word sequences with references .
More recent work extends ROUGE with WordNet ( ShafieiBavani et al. , 2018a ) , word embeddings ( Ng and Abrecht , 2015 ) , or use contextualizedembedding - based methods ( Zhang et al. , 2019 ; Zhao et al. , 2019 ) to measure the semantic similarity between references and summaries .
Annotation - based Evaluation .
Some methods directly ask human annotators to rate summaries following some guidelines , e.g. Responsiveness , which measures the overall quality ( relevance , fluency and readability ) of summaries , and Pyramid ( Nenkova and Passonneau , 2004 ) , which measures summaries ' relevance .
Recently , systems have been developed to ease the construction of Pyramid scores , e.g. ( Hirao et al. , 2018 ; Yang et al. , 2016 ; Gao et al. , 2019 b ; , but they still require human-annotated Summary Content Units ( SCUs ) to produce reliable scores .
Besides SCUs , recent work has explored eliciting preferences over summaries ( Zopf , 2018 ; Gao et al. , 2018
Gao et al. , , 2019a and annotations of important bi-grams ( P.V.S and Meyer , 2017 ) to derive summary ratings .
Some methods collect human ratings on a small number of summaries to train an evaluation function .
Peyrard et al . ( 2017 ) ; Peyrard and Gurevych ( 2018 ) propose to learn an evaluation function from Pyramid and Responsiveness scores , by using classic supervised learning methods with hand -crafted features .
ShafieiBavani et al. ( 2018 b ) use the same idea but design corpus based and lexical re-source based word embeddings to build the features .
B?hm et al. ( 2019 ) train a BERT - based evaluation function with 2,500 human ratings for 500 machinegenerated summaries from the CNN / DailyMail dataset ; their method correlates better with human ratings than ROUGE and BLEU .
However , as their method is designed for evaluating single - document summaries , it correlates poorly with the Pyramid scores for multi-document summaries ( see ?3 ) .
Unsupervised Evaluation .
Louis and Nenkova ( 2013 ) measure the relevance of a summary using multiple heuristics , for example by computing the Jensen - Shannon ( JS ) divergence between the word distributions in the summary and in the source documents .
Ryang and Abekawa ( 2012 ) ; Rioux et al. ( 2014 ) develop evaluation heuristics inspired by the maximal marginal relevance metrics ( Goldstein et al. , 2000 ) .
But these methods have low correlation with human ratings at summary level ( see ?3 ) .
Scialom et al. ( 2019 ) propose to generate questions from source documents and evaluate the relevance of summaries by counting how many questions the summaries can answer .
However , they do not detail how to generate questions from source documents ; also , it remains unclear whether their method works for evaluating multi-document summaries .
Sun and Nenkova ( 2019 ) propose a single-document summary evaluation method , which measures the cosine similarity of the ELMo embeddings ( Peters et al. , 2018 ) of the source document and the summary .
In ?3 , we show that their method performs poorly in evaluating multi-document summaries .
SUPERT extends their method by using more advanced contextualized embeddings and more effective text alignment / matching methods ( ?4 ) , and by introducing pseudo references ( ?5 ) .
Datasets , Baselines and Upper Bounds Datasets .
We use two multi-document summarization datasets from the Text Analysis Conference ( TAC ) 2 shared tasks : TAC '08 and TAC'09 .
In line with Louis and Nenkova ( 2013 ) , we only use the initial summaries ( the A part ) in these datasets .
TAC '08 includes 48 topics and TAC '09 includes 44 .
Each topic has ten news articles , four reference summaries and 57 ( TAC '08 ) and 55 ( TAC '09 ) machine - generated summaries .
Each news article on average has 611 words in 24 sentences .
Each summary has at most 100 words and receives a Pyramid score , which is used as the ground -truth human rating in our experiments .
Baselines & Upper Bounds .
For baselines , we consider TF - IDF , which computes the cosine similarity of the tf-idf vectors of source and summaries ; JS , which computes the JS divergence between the words distributions in source documents and summaries ; and the REAPER heuristics proposed by Rioux et al . ( 2014 ) .
In addition , we use the learned metric from B?hm et al. ( 2019 ) ( B?hm19 ) and the ELMo - based metric by Sun and Nenkova ( 2019 ) ( C ELMo , stands for cosine - ELMo ; see ?2 ) .
In all these methods , we remove stop-words and use the stemmed words , as we find these operations improve the performance .
For C ELMo , we vectorize the documents / summaries by averaging their sentences ' ELMo embeddings .
As for upper bounds , we consider three strong reference - based evaluation metrics : ROUGE - 1/2 and MoverScore ( Zhao et al. , 2019 ) ; note that references are not available for unsupervised evaluation metrics .
We measure the performance of the baselines and upper bounds by their average summary - level correlation with Pyramid , in terms of Pearson 's ( r ) , Spearman 's ( ? ) and Kendall's ( ? ) correlation coefficients .

All baseline methods fall far behind the upper bounds .
Among baselines , the embedding - based methods ( B?hm19 and C ELMo ) perform worse than the other lexical - based baselines .
This observation suggests that to rate multi-document summaries , using exist - .304 .269 .191 .371 .319 .229 MRoBERTa .366 .326 .235 .357 .316 .229 MSBERT .466 .428 .311 .436 .435 .320 Table 2 : Performance of contextual - embedding - based metrics .
Soft aligning the embeddings of the source documents and the summaries ( the bottom part ) yields higher correlation than simply computing the embeddings cosine similarity ( the upper part ) .
ing single- document summaries evaluation metrics ( B?hm19 ) or computing source-summary embeddings ' cosine similarity ( C ELMo ) is ineffective .
Measuring Similarity with Contextualized Embeddings
In this section , we explore the use of more advanced contextualized embeddings and more sophisticated embedding alignment / matching methods ( rather than cosine similarity ) to measure summaries relevance .
We first extend C ELMo by considering more contextualized text encoders : BERT , RoBERTa , ALBERT ( Lan et al. , 2019 ) and SBERT 4 .
We use these encoders to produce embeddings for each sentence in the documents / summaries , and perform average pooling to obtain the vector representations for the documents / summaries .
We measure the relevance of a summary by computing the cosine similarity between its embedding and the embedding of the source documents .
The upper part in Table 2 presents the results .
C SBERT outperforms the other cosine-embedding based metrics by a large margin , but compared to the lexical - based metrics ( see Table 1 ) its performance still falls short .
Zhao et al. ( 2019 ) recently show that , to measure the semantic similarity between two documents , instead of computing their document embeddings cosine similarity , minimizing their token embeddings word mover 's distances ( WMDs ) ( Kusner et al. , 2015 ) yields stronger performance .
By minimizing WMDs , tokens from different documents are soft-aligned , i.e. a token from one document can be aligned to multiple relevant tokens from the other document .
We adopt the same idea to measure the semantic similarity between summaries and TAC'08 TAC '09 r ? ? r ? ?

source documents , using RoBERTa and SBERT ( denoted by M RoBERTa and M SBERT , respectively ) .
The bottom part in Table 2 presents the results .
The WMD - based scores substantially outperform their cosine-embedding counterparts ; in particular , M SBERT outperforms all lexical - based baselines in Table 1 .
This finding suggests that , to rate multidocument summaries , soft word alignment methods should be used on top of contextualized embeddings to achieve good performance .
Building Pseudo References WMD - based metrics yield the highest correlation in both reference - based ( bottom row in Table 1 ) and reference -free ( bottom row in Table 2 ) settings , but there exists a large gap between their correlation scores .
This observation highlights the need for reference summaries .
In this section , we explore multiple heuristics to build pseudo references .
Simple heuristics
We first consider two simple strategies to build pseudo references : randomly extracting N sentences or extracting the first N sentences from each source document .
Results , presented in Table 3 , suggest that extracting the top 10 - 15 sentences as the pseudo references yields strong performance : it outperforms the lexical - based baselines ( upper part in Table 1 ) by over 16 % and M SBERT ( Table 2 ) by over 4 % .
These findings confirm the position bias in news articles ( c.f. ( Jung et al. , 2019 ) ) .
Graph - based heuristics Graph- based methods have long been used to select salient information from documents , e.g. ( Erkan and Radev , 2004 ; Zheng and Lapata , 2019 ) .
These methods build grahs to represent the source docu-ments , in which each vertex represents a sentence and the weight of each edge is decided by the similarity of the corresponding sentence pair .
Below , we explore two families of graph - based methods to build pseudo references : position - agnostic and position - aware graphs , which ignore and consider the sentences ' positional information , respectively .
Position -Agnostic Graphs .
The first graph we consider is SBERT - based LexRank ( SLR ) , which extends the classic LexRank ( Erkan and Radev , 2004 ) method by measuring the similarity of sentences using SBERT embeddings cosine similarity .
In addition , we propose an SBERT - based clustering ( SC ) method to build graphs , which first measures the similarity of sentence pairs using SBERT , and then clusters sentences by using the affinity propagation ( Frey and Dueck , 2007 ) clustering algorithm ; the center of each cluster is selected to build the pseudo reference .
We choose affinity propagation because it does not require a preset cluster number ( unlike K-Means ) and it automatically finds the center point of each cluster .
For each method ( SLR or SC ) , we consider two variants : the individual - graph version , which builds a graph for each source document and selects top -K sentences ( SLR ) or the centers ( SC ) from each graph ; and the global - graph version , which builds a graph considering all sentences across all source documents for the same topic , and selects the top -M sentences ( SLR ) or all the centers ( SC ) in this large graph .
According to our preliminary experiments on 20 randomly sampled topics , we set K = 10 and M = 90 .
Position - Aware Graphs .
PacSum is a recently proposed graph - based method to select salient sentences from multiple documents ( Zheng and Lapata , 2019 ) .
In PacSum , a sentence is more likely to be selected if it has higher average similarity with its succeeding sentences and lower average similarity with its preceding sentences .
This strategy allows PacSum to prioritize the selection of earlyposition and " semantically central " sentences .
We further extend PacSum by using SBERT to measure sentences similarity ( the resulting method is denoted as SPS ) and consider both the individualand global - graph versions of SPS .
Furthermore , we propose a method called Top +Clique ( TC ) , which selects the top -N sentences and the semantically central non-top - N sentences to build the pseudo references .
TC adopts .456 .417 .304 .415 .423 .311 SLRG .461 .423 .306 .419 .423 .310 SCI .409 .364 .261 .393 .383 .280 SCG .383 .344 .245 .373 .365 .265 Position - aware graphs SPSI . 478 .437 .319 .429 .435 .321 SPSG .472 .432 .313 .427 .432 .318 TC .490 .449 .329 .450 .454 .336
Table 4 : Building pseudo references by positionagnostic ( upper ) and position - aware ( bottom ) graphs .
the following steps : ( i ) Label top - N sentences from each document as salient .
( ii ) With the remaining ( non - top - N ) sentences , build a graph such that only " highly similar " sentences have an edge between them .
( iii )
Obtain the cliques from the graph and select the semantically central sentence ( i.e. the sentence with highest average similarity with other sentences in the clique ) from each clique as potentially salient sentences .
( iv ) For each potentially salient sentence , label it as salient if it is not highly similar to any top -N sentences .
Based on preliminary experiments on 20 topics , we let N = 10 and the threshold value be 0.75 for " highly similar " .
Table 4 presents the graph- based methods ' performance .
Except for SC G , all other graph - based methods outperform baselines in Table 1 . Positionagnostic graph - based methods perform worse not only than the the position - aware ones , but even than the best method in Table 2 , which simply uses the full source documents as pseudo references .
In addition , we find that the position - aware graph - based sentence extraction methods perform worse than simply extracting top sentences ( Table 3 ) .
These findings indicate that the position bias remains the most effective heuristic in selecting salient information from news articles ; when position information is unavailable ( e.g. sentences in source documents are randomly shuffled ) , it might be better to use all sentences rather than selecting a subset of sentences from the source to build pseudo references .
Guiding Reinforcement Learning
We explore the use of different rewards to guide Neural Temporal Difference ( NTD ) , a RL - based multi-document summarizer ( Gao et al. , 2019a ) .
We consider three unsupervised reward functions : two baseline methods REAPER and JS ( see ?3 and Table 1 ) , and the best version of SUPERT , which selects the top 10 ( TAC '08 ) or 15 ( TAC '09 ) sentences from each source document to build pseudo references and uses SBERT to measure the similarity between summaries and pseudo references .
In addition , we consider a non -RL - based stateof - the - art unsupervised summarizer proposed by Yogatama et al . ( 2015 ) ( YLS15 ) .
We use ROUGE to measure the quality of the generated summaries and leave human evaluations for future work .
Table 5 presents the results .
We find SUPERT is the strongest reward among the considered rewards : it helps NTD perform on par with YSL15 on TAC '08 and perform significantly better on TAC'09 .
Conclusion
We explored unsupervised multi-document summary evaluation methods , which require neither reference summaries nor human annotations .
We find that vectorizing the summary and the top sentences in the source documents using contextualized embeddings , and measuring their semantic overlap with soft token alignment techniques is a simple yet effective method to rate the summary 's quality .
The resulting method , SUPERT , correlates with human ratings substantially better than the state - of - the - art unsupervised metrics .
Furthermore , we use SUPERT as rewards to train a neural - RL - based summarizer , which leads to up to 17 % quality improvement ( in ROUGE - 2 ) compared to the state - of - the - art unsupervised summarizers .
This result not only shows the effectiveness of SUPERT in a downstream task , but also promises a new way to train RL - based summarizers : an infinite number of summary - reward pairs can be created from infintely many documents , and their SUPERT scores can be used as rewards to train RL - based summarizers , fundamentally relieving the data-hungriness problem faced by existing RL - based summarization systems .
