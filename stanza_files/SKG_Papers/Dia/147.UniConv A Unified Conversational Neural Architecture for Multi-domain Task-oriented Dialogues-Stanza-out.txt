UniConv : A Unified Conversational Neural Architecture for Multi-domain Task-oriented Dialogues
abstract
Building an end-to- end conversational agent for multi-domain task - oriented dialogues has been an open challenge for two main reasons .
First , tracking dialogue states of multiple domains is non-trivial as the dialogue agent must obtain complete states from all relevant domains , some of which might have shared slots among domains as well as unique slots specifically for one domain only .
Second , the dialogue agent must also process various types of information across domains , including dialogue context , dialogue states , and database , to generate natural responses to users .
Unlike the existing approaches that are often designed to train each module separately , we propose " UniConv " - a novel unified neural architecture for end-to - end conversational systems in multi-domain task - oriented dialogues , which is designed to jointly train ( i ) a Bi-level State Tracker which tracks dialogue states by learning signals at both slot and domain level independently , and ( ii ) a Joint Dialogue Act and Response Generator which incorporates information from various input components and models dialogue acts and target responses simultaneously .
We conduct comprehensive experiments in dialogue state tracking , contextto-text , and end-to - end settings on the Multi-WOZ2.1 benchmark , achieving superior performance over competitive baselines .
Human : hello Dialogue agent : hi ! how can i help you ?
Dialogue state : {} Dialogue acts : [ greeting ]
Human : i would like a place to eat in the expensive price range Dialogue agent : sure , what type of food are you interested in ?
Dialogue state : { restaurant : { pricerange : expensive } } Dialogue acts : [ request-food ]
Human : could you make a suggestion ? one in the centre ?
Dialogue agent : fitzbillies restaurant is an expensive british restaurant in the centre . can i book that for you ?
Dialogue state : { restaurant : { pricerange : expensive , area : centre} }
Dialogue acts : [ inform-restaurant , request-booking ] ... ...
Introduction
A conventional approach to task - oriented dialogues is to solve four distinct tasks : ( 1 ) natural language understanding ( NLU ) which parses user utterance into a semantic frame , ( 2 ) dialogue state tracking ( DST ) which updates the slots and values from semantic frames to the latest values for knowledge base retrieval , ( 3 ) dialogue policy which determines an appropriate dialogue act for the next system response , and ( 4 ) response generation which generates a natural language sequence conditioned on the dialogue act .
This traditional pipeline modular framework has achieved remarkable successes in task - oriented dialogues ( Wen et al. , 2017 ; Liu and Lane , 2017 ; Williams et al. , 2017 ; Zhao et al. , 2017 ) .
However , such kind of dialogue system is not fully optimized as the modules are loosely integrated and often not trained jointly in an end-to - end manner , and thus may suffer from increasing error propagation between the modules as the complexity of the dialogues evolves .
A typical case of a complex dialogue setting is when the dialogue extends over multiple domains .
A dialogue state in a multi-domain dialogue should include slots of all applicable domains up to the current turn ( See Table 1 ) .
Each domain can have shared slots that are common among domains or unique slots that are not shared with any .
Directly applying single- domain DST to multi-domain dialogues is not straightforward because the dialogue states extend to multiple domains .
A possible approach is to process a dialogue of N D domains multiple times , each time obtaining a dialogue state of one domain .
However , this approach does not allow learning co-reference in dialogues in which users can switch from one domain to another .
As the number of dialogue domains increases , traditional pipeline approaches propagate errors from dialogue states to dialogue policy and subsequently , to natural language generator .
Recent efforts Madotto et al. , 2018 ; Wu et al. , 2019 b ) address this problem with an integrated sequence - to-sequence structure .
These approaches often consider knowledge bases as memory tuples rather than relational entity tables .
While achieving impressive performance , these approaches are not scalable to large-scale knowledgebases , e.g. thousands of entities , as the memory cost to query entity attributes increases substantially .
Another limitation of these approaches is the absence of dialogue act modelling .
Dialogue act is particularly important in task - oriented dialogues as it determines the general decision towards task completion before a dialogue agent can materialize it into natural language response ( See Table 1 ) .
To tackle the challenges in multi-domain taskoriented dialogues while reducing error propagation among dialogue system modules and keeping the models scalable , we propose UniConv , a unified neural network architecture for end-to - end dialogue systems .
UniConv consists of a Bi-level State Tracking ( BDST ) module which embeds natural language understanding as it can directly parse dialogue context into a structured dialogue state rather than relying on the semantic frame output from an NLU module in each dialogue turn .
BDST implicitly models and integrates slot representations from dialogue contextual cues to directly generate slot values in each turn and thus , remove the need for explicit slot tagging features from an NLU .
This approach is more practical than the traditional pipeline models as we do not need slot tagging annotation .
Furthermore , BDST tracks dialogue states in dialogue context in both slot and domain levels .
The output representations from two levels are combined in a late fusion approach to learn multi-domain dialogue states .
Our dialogue state tracker disentangles slot and domain representation learning while enabling deep learning of shared representations of slots common among domains .
UniConv integrates BDST with a Joint Dialogue Act and Response Generator ( DARG ) that simultaneously models dialogue acts and generates system responses by learning a latent variable representing dialogue acts and semantically conditioning output response tokens on this latent variable .
The multitask setting of DARG allows our models to model dialogue acts and utilize the distributed representations of dialogue acts , rather than hard discrete output values from a dialogue policy module , on output response tokens .
Our response generator incorporates information from dialogue input components and intermediate representations progressively over multiple attention steps .
The output representations are refined after each step to obtain high-resolution signals needed to generate appropriate dialogue acts and responses .
We combine both BDST and DARG for end-to - end neural dialogue systems , from input dialogues to output system responses .
We evaluate our models on the large-scale Mul-tiWOZ benchmark , and compare with the existing methods in DST , context - to - text generation , and end-to - end settings .
The promising performance in all tasks validates the efficacy of our method .
Related Work Dialogue State Tracking .
Traditionally , DST models are designed to track states of singledomain dialogues such as WOZ ( Wen et al. , 2017 ) and DSTC2 ( Henderson et al. , 2014a ) benchmarks .
There have been recent efforts that aim to tackle multi-domain DST such as ( Ramadan et al. , 2018 ; Lee et al. , 2019 ; Wu et al. , 2019a ; .
These models can be categorized into two main categories :
Fixed vocabulary models ( Zhong et al. , 2018 ; Ramadan et al. , 2018 ; Lee et al. , 2019 ) , which assume known slot ontology with a fixed candidate set for each slot .
On the other hand , open-vocabulary models ( Lei et al. , 2018 ; Wu et al. , 2019a ; Le et al. , 2020 ) derive the candidate set based on the source sequence i.e. dialogue history , itself .
Our approach is more related to the open-vocabulary approach as we aim to generate unique dialogue states depending on the input dialogue .
Different from previous generation - based approaches , our state tracker can incorporate contextual information into domain and slot representations independently .
Z dst Context- to - Text Generation .
This task was traditionally solved by two separate dialogue modules : Dialogue Policy ( Peng et al. , 2017 ( Peng et al. , , 2018 and NLG ( Wen et al. , 2016 ; Su et al. , 2018 ) .
Recent work attempts to combine these two modules to directly generate system responses with or without modeling dialogue acts .
Zhao et al. ( 2019 ) models action space of dialogue agent as latent variables .
predicts dialogue acts using a hierarchical graph structure with each path representing a unique act .
Pei et al . ( 2019 ) ; Peng et al. ( 2019 ) use multiple dialogue agents , each trained for a specific dialogue domain , and combine them through a common dialogue agent .
Mehri et al. ( 2019 ) models dialogue policy and NLG separately and fuses feature representations at different levels to generate responses .
Our models simultaneously learn dialogue acts as a latent variable while allowing semantic conditioning on distributed representations of dialogue acts rather than hard discrete features .
End-to - End Dialogue Systems .
In this task , conventional approaches combine Natural Language Understanding ( NLU ) , DST , Dialogue Policy , and NLG , into a pipeline architecture ( Wen et al. , 2017 ; Bordes et al. , 2016 ; Liu and Lane , 2017 ; Liu and Perez , 2017 ; Williams et al. , 2017 ; Zhao et al. , 2017 ; Jhunjhunwala et al. , 2020 ) .
Another framework does not explicitly modularize these components but incorporate them through a sequence- to- sequence framework Lei et al. , 2018 ; Yavuz et al. , 2019 ) and a memory - based entity dataset of triplets Madotto et al. , 2018 ; Gangi Reddy et al. , 2019 ; Wu et al. , 2019 b ) .
These approaches bypass dialogue state and / or act modeling and aim to generate output responses directly .
They achieve impressive success in generating dialogue responses in open-domain dialogues with unstructured knowledge bases .
However , in a task - oriented setting with an entity dataset , they might suffer from an explosion of memory size when the number of entities from multiple dialogue domains increases .
Our work is more related to the traditional pipeline strategy but we integrate our dialogue models by unifying two major components rather than using the traditional four-module architecture , to alleviate error propagation from upstream to downstream components .
Different from prior work such as ( Shu et al. , 2019 ) , our model facilitates multi-domain state tracking and allows learning dialogue acts during response generation .
Method
The input consists of dialogue context of t?1 turns , each including a pair of user utterance U and system response R , ( U 1 , R 1 ) , ... , ( U t?1 , R t?1 ) , and the user utterance at current turn U t .
A taskoriented dialogue system aims to generate the next response R t .
The information for responses is typically queried from a database based on the user 's provided information i.e. inform slots tracked by a DST .
We assume access to a database of all domains with each column corresponding to a specific slot being tracked .
We denote the intermediate output , including the dialogue state of current turn B t and dialogue act as A t .
We denote the list of all domains D = ( d 1 , d 2 , ... ) , all slots S = ( s 1 , s 2 , ... ) , and all acts A = ( a 1 , a 2 , ... ) .
We also denote the list of all ( domain , slot ) pairs as DS = ( ds 1 , ds 2 , ... ) .
Note that DS ? D ?
S as some slots might not be applicable in all domains .
Given the current dialogue turn t , we represent each text input as a sequence of tokens , each of which is a unique token index from a vocabulary set V : dialogue context X ctx , current user utterance X utt , and target system response X res .
Similarly , we also represent the list of domains as X D and the list of slots as X S .
In DST , we consider the raw text form of dialogue state of the previous turn B t?1 , similarly as ( Lei et al. , 2018 ; Budzianowski and Vuli ? , 2019 ) .
In the context- to - text setting , we assume access to the ground - truth dialogue states of current turn B t .
The dialogue state of the previous and current turn can then be represented as a sequence of tokens X prev st and X curr st respectively .
For a fair comparison with current approaches , during inference , we use the model predicted dialogue states Xprev st and do not use X curr st in DST and end-to - end tasks .
Following ( Wen et al. , 2015 ; , we consider the delexicalized target response X dl res by replacing tokens of slot values by their corresponding generic tokens to allow learning valueindependent parameters .
Our model consists of 3 major components ( See Figure 1 ) .
First , Encoders encode all text input into continuous representations .
To make it consistent , we encode all input with the same embedding dimension .
Secondly , our Bi-level State Tracker ( BDST ) is used to detect contextual dependencies to generate dialogue states .
The DST includes 2 modules for slot-level and domain-level representation learning .
Each module comprises attention layers to project domain or slot representations and incorporate important information from dialogue context , dialogue state of the previous turn , and current user utterance .
The outputs are combined as a context - aware vector to decode the corresponding inform or request slots in each domain .
Lastly , our Joint Dialogue Act and Response Generator ( DARG ) projects the target system response representations and enhances them with information from various dialogue components .
Our response generator can also learn a latent representation to generate dialogue acts , which condition all target tokens during each generation step .
Encoders
An encoder encodes a text sequence X to a sequence of continuous representation Z ? R L X ?d . L X is the length of sequence X and d is the embedding dimension .
Each encoder includes a token - level embedding layer .
The embedding layer is a trainable embedding matrix E ? R V ?d . Each row represents a token in the vocabulary set V as a d-dimensional vector .
We denote E( X ) as the embedding function that transform the sequence X by looking up the respective token index : Z emb = E( X ) ? R L X ?d .
We inject the positional attribute of each token as similarly adopted in ( Vaswani et al. , 2017 ) .
The positional encoding is denoted as P E .
The final embedding is the element-wise summation between token -embedded representations and positional encoded representations with layer normalization ( Ba et al. , 2016 ) : Z = LayerNorm ( Z emb + P E ( X ) ) ? R L X ?d .
The encoder outputs include representations of dialogue context Z ctx , current user utterance Z utt , and target response Z dl res .
We also encode the dialogue states of the previous turn and current turn and obtain Z prev st and Z curr st respectively .
We encode X S and X D using only token - level embedding layer : Z S = LayerNorm ( E ( X S ) ) and Z D = LayerNorm ( E ( X D ) ) .
During training , we shift the target response by one position to the left side to allow auto-regressive prediction in each generation step .
We share the embedding matrix E to encode all text tokens except for tokens of target responses as the delexicalized outputs contain different semantics from natural language inputs .
Bi-level Dialogue State Tracker ( BDST ) Slot-level DST .
We adopt the Transformer attention ( Vaswani et al. , 2017 ) , which consists of a dot-product attention with skip connection , to integrate dialogue contextual information into each slot representation .
We denote Att( Z 1 , Z 2 ) as the attention operation from Z 2 on Z 1 .
We first enable models to process all slot representations together rather than separately as in previous DST models ( Ramadan et al. , 2018 ; Wu et al. , 2019a ) .
This strategy allows our models to explicitly learn dependencies between all pairs of slots .
Many pairs of slots could exhibit correlation such as time - wise relation ( " departure_time " and " arrival_time " ) .
We obtain Z dst SS = Att( Z S , Z S ) ? R S ?d .
We incorporate the dialogue information by learning dependencies between each slot representation and each token in the dialogue history .
Previous approaches such as ( Budzianowski and Vuli? , 2019 ) consider all dialogue history as a single sequence but we separate them into two inputs because the information in X utt is usually more important to generate responses while X ctx includes more background information .
We then obtain Z dst S , ctx = Att ( Z ctx , Z dst SS ) ?
R S ?d and Z dst S , utt = Att ( Z utt , Z dst S , ctx ) ? R S ?d . Following ( Lei et al. , 2018 ) , we incorporate dialogue state of the previous turn B t?1 which is a more compact representation of dialogue context .
Hence , we can replace the full dialogue context to only R t?1 as the remaining part is represented in B t?1 .
This approach avoids taking in all dialogue history and is scalable as the conversation grows longer .
We add the attention layer to obtain Z dst S , st = Att ( Z prev st , Z dst S , ctx ) ? R S ?d ( See Figure 1 ) .
We further improve the feature representations by repeating the attention sequence over N dst S times .
We denote the final output Z dst S . Domain-level DST .
We adopt a similar architecture to learn domain-level representations .
The representations learned in this module exhibit global information while slot-level representations contain local dependencies to decode multi-domain dialogue states .
First , we enable the domain-level DST to capture dependencies between all pairs of domains .
For example , some domains such as " taxi " are typically paired with other domains such as " attraction " , but usually not with the " train " domain .
We then obtain Z dst DD = Att( Z D , Z D ) ? R D ?d .
We then allow models to capture dependencies between each domain representation and each token in dialogue context and current user utterance .
By segregating dialogue context and current utterance , our models can potentially detect changes of dialogue domains from past turns to the current turn .
Especially in multi-domain dialogues , users can switch from one domain to another and the next system response should address the latest domain .
We then obtain Z dst D , ctx = Att ( Z ctx , Z dst DD ) ?
R D ?d and Z dst D , utt = Att ( Z utt , Z dst D , ctx ) ?
R D ?d se- quentially .
Similar to the slot-level module , we refine feature representations over N dst D times and denote the final output as Z dst D . Domain - Slot DST .
We combined domain and slot representations by expanding the tensors to identical dimensions i.e. D ? S ? d. We then apply Hadamard product , resulting in domain-slot joint features Z dst DS ? R D ? S ?d .
We then apply a self-attention layer to allow learning of dependencies between joint domain-slot features : Z dst = Att ( Z dst DS , Z dst DS ) ? R D ? S ?d .
In this attention , we mask the intermediate representations in positions of invalid domain-slot pairs .
Compared to previous work such as ( Wu et al. , 2019a ) , we adopt a late fusion method whereby domain and slot representations are integrated in deeper layers .
State Generator
The representations Z dst are used as context - aware representations to decode individual dialogue states .
Given a domain index i and slot index j , the feature vector Z dst [ i , j , :] ?
R d is used to generate value of the corresponding ( domain , slot ) pair .
The vector is used as an initial hidden state for an RNN decoder to decode an inform slot value .
Given the k-th ( domain , slot ) pair and decoding step l , the output hidden state in each recurrent step h kl is passed through a linear transformation with softmax to obtain output distribution over vocabulary set V : P inf kl = Softmax ( h kl W inf ) ?
R V where W inf dst ?
R drnn ?
V . For request slot of k-th ( domain , slot ) pair , we pass the corresponding vector Z dst vector through a linear layer with sigmoid activation to predict a value of 0 or 1 .
P req k = Sigmoid( Z dst k W req ) .
Optimization .
The DST is optimized by the crossentropy loss functions of inform and request slots : L dst = L inf + L req = DS k=1 Y k l=1 ? log ( P inf kl ( y kl ) ) + DS k=1 ?y k log ( P req k ) ?
( 1 ? y k ) ( 1 ? log ( P req k ) ) 3.3 Joint Dialogue Act and Response Generator ( DARG ) Database Representations .
Following , we create a one- hot vector for each domain d : x d db ? { 0 , 1 } 6 and 6 i x d db , i = 1 .
Each position of the vector indicates a number or a range of entities .
The vectors of all domains are concatenated to create a multi-domain vector X db ? R 6 ?
D . We embed this vector as described in Section 3.1 .
Response Generation .
We adopt a stackedattention architecture that sequentially learns dependencies between each token in target responses with each dialogue component representation .
First , we obtain Z gen res = Att ( Z res , Z res ) ? R Lres?d .
This attention layer can learn semantics within the target response to construct a more semantically structured sequence .
We then use attention to capture dependencies in background information contained in dialogue context and user utterance .
The outputs are Z gen ctx = Att ( Z ctx , Z gen res ) ?
R Lres?d and Z gen utt = Att ( Z utt , Z gen ctx ) ?
R Lres ?d sequentially .
To incorporate information of dialogue states and DB results , we apply attention steps to capture dependencies between each response token representation and state or DB representation .
Specifically , we first obtain Z gen dst = Att ( Z dst , Z gen utt ) ? R Lres?d .
In the context- to - text setting , as we directly use the ground - truth dialogue states , we simply replace Z dst with Z curr st .
Then we obtain Z gen db = Att ( Z db , Z gen dst ) ? R Lres?d .
These attention layers capture the information needed to generate tokens that are towards task completion and supplement the contextual cues obtained in previous attention layers .
We let the models to progressively capture these dependencies for N gen times and denote the final output as Z gen .
The final output is passed to a linear layer with softmax activation to decode system responses auto-regressively : P res = Softmax ( Z gen W gen ) ? R Lres ? Vres Dialogue Act Modeling .
We couple response generation with dialogue act modeling by learning a latent variable Z act ?
R d .
We place the vector in the first position of Z res , resulting in Z res+act ? R ( Lres + 1 ) ? d .
We then pass this tensor to the same stacked attention layers as above .
By adding the latent variable in the first position , we allow our model to semantically condition all downstream tokens from second position , i.e. all tokens in the target response , on this latent variable .
The output representation of the latent vector i.e. ) by domain first row in Z gen , incorporates contextual signals accumulated from all attention layers and is used to predict dialogue acts .
We denote this representation as Z gen act and pass it through a linear layer to obtain a multi-hot encoded tensor .
We apply Sigmoid on this tensor to classify each dialogue act as 0 or 1 : P act = Sigmoid ( Z gen act W act ) ? R A . Optimization .
The response generator is jointly trained by the cross-entropy loss functions of generated responses and dialogue acts : L gen = L res + L act = Yres l=1 ? log ( P res l ( y l ) ) + A a=1 ?y a log ( P act a ) ?
( 1 ? y a ) ( 1 ? log ( P act a ) )
4 Experiments
Dataset
We evaluate our models with the multi-domain dialogue corpus MultiWOZ 2.0 and 2.1 ( Eric et al. , 2019 ) ( The latter includes corrected state labels for the DST task ) .
From the dialogue state annotation of the training data , we identified all possible domains and slots .
We identified D = 7 domains and S = 30 slots , including 19 inform slots and 11 request slots .
We also identified A = 32 acts .
The corpus includes 8,438 dialogues in the training set and 1,000 in each validation and test set .
We present a summary of the dataset in Table 2 .
For additional information of data pre-processing procedures , domains , slots , and entity DBs , please refer to Appendix A .
Experiment Setup
We select d = 256 , h att = 8 , N dst S = N dst D = N gen = 3 .
We employed dropout ( Srivastava et al. , 2014 ) of 0.3 and label smoothing ( Szegedy et al. , 2016 ) on target system responses during training .

We adopt a teacher - forcing training strategy by simply using the ground - truth inputs of dialogue state of the previous turn and the gold DB representations .
During inference in DST and end-to - end tasks , we decode system responses sequentially turn by turn , using the previously decoded state as input in the current turn , and at each turn , using the new predicted state to query DBs .
We train all networks with Adam optimizer ( Kingma and Ba , 2015 ) and a decaying learning rate schedule .
All models are trained up to 30 epochs and the best models are selected based on validation loss .
We used a greedy approach to decode all slots and a beam search with beam size 5 .
To evaluate the models , we use the following metrics : Joint Accuracy and Slot Accuracy ( Henderson et al. , 2014 b ) , Inform and Success ( Wen et al. , 2017 ) , and BLEU score ( Papineni et al. , 2002 ) .
As suggested by Liu et al . ( 2016 ) , human evaluation , even though popular in dialogue research , might not be necessary in tasks with domain constraints such as MultiWOZ .
We implemented all models using Pytorch and will release our code on github 1 .
Results DST .
We test our state tracker ( i.e. using only L dst ) and compare the performance with the baseline models in Table 3 ( Refer to Appendix B for description of DST baselines ) .
Our model can outperform fixed - vocabulary approaches such as HJST and FJST , showing the advantage of generating unique slot values rather than relying on a slot ontology with a fixed set of candidates .
DST
Reader model does not perform well and we note that many slot values are not easily expressed as a text span in source text inputs .
DST approaches that separate domain and slot representations such as TRADE ( Wu et al. , 2019a ) reveal 1 https://github.com/henryhungle/
UniConv competitive performance .
However , our approach has better performance as we adopt a late fusion strategy to explicitly obtain more fine - grained contextual dependencies in each domain and slot representation .
In this aspect , our model is related to TSCP ( Lei et al. , 2018 ) which decodes output state sequence auto-regressively .
However , TSCP attempts to learn domain and slot dependencies implicitly and the model is limited by selecting the maximum output state length ( which can vary significantly in multi-domain dialogues ) .
Context- to- Text Generation .
We compare with existing baselines in Table 4 ( Refer to Appendix B for description of the baseline models ) .
Our model achieves very competitive Inform , Success , and BLEU scores .
Compared to TokenMOE ( Pei et al. , 2019 ) , our single model can outperform multiple domain-specific dialogue agents as each attention module can sufficiently learn contextual features of multiple domains .
Compared to HDSA which uses a graph structure to represent acts , our approach is simpler yet able to outperform HDSA in Inform score .
Our work is related to Structured Fusion ( Mehri et al. , 2019 ) as we incorporate intermediate representations during decoding .
However , our approach does not rely on pretraining individual sub-modules but simultaneously learning both act representations and predicting output tokens .
Similarly , our stacked attention architecture can achieve good performance in BLEU score , competitively with a GPT - 2 based model ( Budzianowski and Vuli? , 2019 ) , while consistently improve other metrics .
For completion , we tested our models on MultiWOZ2.1 and achieved similar results : 87.90 % Inform , 72.70 % Success , and 18.52 BLEU score .
Future work may further improve Success by optimizing the models towards a higher success rate using strategies such as LaRL ( Zhao et al. , 2019 ) .
Another direction is a data augmentation approach such as DAMD ( Zhang et al. , Model Joint Acc Slot Acc Inform Success BLEU TSCP ( L=8 ) ( Lei et al. , 2018 ) 31.64 % 95.53 % 45.31 % 38.12 % 11.63 TSCP ( L=20 ) ( Lei et al. , 2018 ) 37 2019 ) which achieves significant performance gain in this task .
End-to- End .
From Table 5 , our model outperforms existing baselines in all metrics except the Inform score ( See Appendix B for a description of baseline models ) .
In TSCP ( Lei et al. , 2018 ) , increasing the maximum dialogue state span L from 8 to 20 tokens helps to improve the DST performance , but also increases the training time significantly .
Compared with HRED -TS ( Peng et al. , 2019 ) , our single model generates better responses in all domains without relying on multiple domainspecific teacher models .
We also noted that the performance of DST improves in contrast to the previous DST task .
This can be explained as additional supervision from system responses not only contributes to learn a natural response but also positively impact the DST component .
Other baseline models such as Wu et al. , 2019 b ) present challenges in the MultiWOZ benchmark as the models could not fully optimize due to the large scale entity memory .
For example , following GLMP ( Wu et al. , 2019 b ) , the restaurant domain alone has over 1,000 memory tuples of ( Subject , Relation , Object ) .
Ablation .
We conduct a comprehensive ablation analysis with several model variants in Table 6 and have the following observations : ?
The model variant with a single- level DST ( by considering S = DS and N dst D = 0 ) ( Row A2 ) performs worse than the Bi-level DST ( Row A1 ) .
In addition , using the dual architecture also improves the latency in each attention layers as typically D + S DS .
The performance gap also indicates the potential of separating global and local dialogue state dependencies by domain and slot level .
?
Using B t?1 and only the last user utterance as the dialogue context ( Row A1 and B1 ) performs as well as using B t?1 and a full-length dialogue history ( Row A5 and B3 ) .
This demonstrates that the information from the last dialogue state is sufficient to represent the dialogue history up to the last user utterance .
One benefit from not using the full dialogue history is that it reduces the memory cost as the number of tokens in a full-length dialogue history is much larger than that of a dialogue state ( particularly as the conversation evolves over many turns ) .
?
We note that removing the loss function to learn the dialogue act latent variable ( Row B2 ) can hurt the generation performance , especially by the task completion metrics Inform and Success .
This is interesting as we expect dialogue acts affect the general semantics of output sentences , indicated by BLEU score , rather than the model ability to retrieve correct entities .
This reveals the benefit of our approach .
By enforcing a semantic condition on each token of the target response , the model can facility the dialogue flow towards successful task completion .
?
In both state tracker and response generator modules , we note that learning feature representations through deeper attention networks can improve the quality of predicted states and system responses .
This is consistent with our DST performance as compared to baseline models of shallow networks .
?
Lastly , in the end-to - end task , our model achieves better performance as the number of attention heads increases , by learning more high-resolution dependencies .
Domain-dependent Results DST .
For state tracking , the metrics are calculated for domain-specific slots of the corresponding domain at each dialogue turn .
We also report the DST separately for multi-domain and single-domain dialogues to evaluate the challenges in multi-domain dialogues and our DST performance gap as compared to single -domain dialogues .
From our DST performs consistently well in the 3 domains attraction , restaurant , and train domains .
However , the performance drops in the taxi and hotel domain , significantly in the taxi domain .
We note that dialogues with the taxi domain is usually not single - domain but typically entangled with other domains .
Secondly , we observe that there is a significant performance gap of about 10 points absolute score between DST performances in singledomain and multi-domain dialogues .
State tracking in multi-domain dialogues is , hence , could be further improved to boost the overall performance .
Additionally , we report qualitative analysis and the insights can be seen in Appendix C.
Conclusion
We proposed UniConv , a novel unified neural architecture of conversational agents for Multi-domain Task-oriented Dialogues , which jointly trains ( 1 ) a Bi-level State Tracker to capture dependencies in both domain and slot levels simultaneously , and ( 2 ) a Joint Dialogue Act and Response Generator to model dialogue act latent variable and semantically conditions output responses with contextual cues .
The promising performance of UniConv on the MultiWOZ benchmark ( including three tasks : DST , context - to- text generation , and end-to- end dialogues ) validates the efficacy of our method .
A Data Pre-processing First , we delexicalize each target system response sequence by replacing the matched entity attribute that appears in the sequence to the canonical tag domain_slot .
For example , the original target response ' the train id is tr8259 departing from cambridge ' is delexicalized into ' the train id is train_id departing from train_departure ' .
We use the provided entity databases ( DBs ) to match potential attributes in all target system responses .
To construct dialogue history , we keep the original version of all text , including system responses of previous turns , rather than the delexicalized form .
We split all sequences of dialogue history , user utterances of the current turn , dialogue states , and delexicalized target responses , into case - insensitive tokens .
We share the embedding weights of all source sequences , including dialogue history , user utterance , and dialogue states , but use a separate embedding matrix to encode the target system responses .
We summarize the number of dialogues in each domain in Table 2 .
For each domain , a dialogue is selected as long as the whole dialogue ( i.e. singledomain dialogue ) or parts of the dialogue ( i.e. in multi-domain dialogue ) is involved with the domain .
For each domain , we also build a set of possible inform and request slots using the dialogue state annotation in the training data .
The details of slots and database in each domain can be seen in Table 9 .
The DBs of 3 domains taxi , police , and hospital are not available as part of the benchmark .
On average , each dialogue has 1.8 domains and extends over 13 turns .
