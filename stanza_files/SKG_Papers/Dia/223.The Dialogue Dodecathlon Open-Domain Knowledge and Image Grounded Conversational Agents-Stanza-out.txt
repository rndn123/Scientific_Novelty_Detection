The Dialogue Dodecathlon : Open-Domain Knowledge and Image Grounded Conversational Agents
abstract
We introduce dodecaDialogue : a set of 12 tasks that measures if a conversational agent can communicate engagingly with personality and empathy , ask questions , answer questions by utilizing knowledge resources , discuss topics and situations , and perceive and converse about images .
By multi-tasking on such a broad large-scale set of data , we hope to both move towards and measure progress in producing a single unified agent that can perceive , reason and converse with humans in an open-domain setting .
We show that such multi-tasking improves over a BERT pretrained baseline , largely due to multi-tasking with very large dialogue datasets in a similar domain , and that the multi-tasking in general provides gains to both text and image - based tasks using several metrics in both the finetune and task transfer settings .
We obtain stateof - the- art results on many of the tasks , providing a strong baseline for this challenge .
Introduction
One of the goals of AI is to build a seeing , talking agent that can discuss , reason , empathize , and provide advice - in short a system that can perform natural communication displaying many of the properties expected when speaking to a human partner .
Ideally , it should be able to be knowledgeable and personable , expert and engaging , serious or humorous - depending on the situation .
It should be capable of answering questions , asking questions , responding to statements , having its own persona , and grounding the dialogue with external information and images .
While no single task exists that can train an agent or measure its ability on all of these axes at once , a number of distinct large-scale datasets targeting subsets of these skills have recently become available .
We thus assemble these disparate tasks to form a single challenge : dodecaDialogue , consisting of 12 subtasks .
Each contains both training data to build the skills we desire for our agent , and validation and test sets to measure our agent 's ability at that skill .
The overall goal is a single agent that can display all these skills .
As some of the subtasks have very large datasets , e.g. 2.2 billion utterances , they can possibly help the agent with other skills too .
We thus build a model capable of training and multi-tasking on all these sources .
We employ a transformer - based architecture ( Vaswani et al. , 2017 ) which accepts an image , external textual information and dialogue history as input , and generates a response for a given dialogue turn .
Practically , by pre-training on the largest of the subtasks and then multi-tasking on all them , we can obtain state - of - the - art results compared to existing independently reported performance on all 10 of the 12 subtasks that have previous comparable results .
We hence set a strong baseline for this challenge .
While many existing approaches use large-scale pre-training on general text corpora , we show that using dialogue datasets instead , which are more closely linked to the desired agent 's goals , is a strong alternative .
However , many challenges remain .
While multitasking performs well , and has clear benefits , as shown in other works ( Liu et al. , 2015 ; Raffel et al. , 2019 ) , when compared to fine-tuning of the same system we do obtain typically small losses .
Zeroshot transfer to left-out tasks is also demanding for current approaches .
We analyze these aspects , along with our model 's ability to ground on external knowledge and images in conjunction with the dialogue context , the impact of decoding algorithms , analysis of the weighting of tasks during multi-tasking as well as cross - task transfer ability in order to shed light and make progress on this challenging topic .
The dodecaDialogue Task
The dodecaDialogue task is intended to assemble important aspects of an engaging conversational agent into a single collection , where each subtask covers some of those goals .
Such an agent should be able to get to know you when you first talk to it ( ConvAI2 ) , discuss everyday topics ( DailyDialog , pushshift .
io Reddit , Twitter , Cornell Movie ) , speak knowledgeably at depth ( Wizard of Wikipedia , Ubuntu ) and answer questions on such topics ( ELI5 ) .
It must be able to handle situated conversations and demonstrate empathy ( Empathetic Dialog , LIGHT ) .
It can also discuss images , as this is a vital part of human connection ( Image Chat , IGC ) .
We note that all of the provided subtasks are in English .
The overall statistics of the subtasks are given in Table 1 .
We now discuss each in turn .
ConvAI2 ConvAI2 is a dataset used at the NeurIPS 2018 competition of the same name , and is based on PersonaChat ( Zhang et al. , 2018 ; Dinan et al. , 2020 ) .
The training data involves paired crowdworkers having a conversation where they get to know each other , in which each is given a role to play based on sentences describing their persona , which were also separately crowdsourced ( while they cannot see their partner 's persona ) .
It thus involves asking and answering questions , responding in kind , and getting to know the other speaker and engaging them in friendly conversation - useful skills for an open-domain conversational agent .
DailyDialog Li et al. ( 2017 ) built a dialogue dataset intended to reflect conversations occurring in daily life .
It covers ten categories ranging from holidays to financial topics , rather than focusing on one domain .
Compared to ConvAI2 , these conversations seem more in keeping with partners who already know each other , and want to discuss typical life details , again useful skills for a conversational agent .
The dataset is also annotated with topic , emotion and utterance acts , but here we ignore these annotations and learn only from the utterances in the dialogue turns .
Wizard of Wikipedia
This task involves discussing a given topic in depth , where the goal is to both engage the partner as well as display expert knowledge .
The training set consists of 1247 topics and a retrieval system over Wikipedia from which the dialogues were grounded during the human-human crowdsourced conversations .
The topics were also crowdsourced and range from e-books to toga parties to showers .
A model can thus learn to also perform similar retrieval and grounding at test time to potentially discuss any topic if it can generalize .
We use the gold knowledge version of the task .
We see this skill as a core component of an agent being able to not just chitchat , but actually engage a user in discussing real information about the world , e.g. by retrieving over documents from the internet .
Rashkin et al. ( 2019 ) constructed a dataset of crowdworker conversations grounded in an emotional situation .
In each dia-logue , one speaker describes a personal situation and the other plays a " listener " role , displaying empathy during the discussion .
The dataset contains descriptions of the situations being discussed with an attached emotion label , but these are not used here .
Trained models are measured playing the part of the empathetic listener , an important feature of an agent to which humans wish to speak .
Empathetic Dialogues Cornell Movie Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil and Lee ( 2011 ) constructed a corpus containing a collection of fictional conversations from movie scripts , thus covering a large diversity of topics and emotional states .
LIGHT LIGHT ( Urbanek et al. , 2019 ) involves situated interactions between characters in a text adventure game .
Similar to ConvAI2 , personas for each character are given , with the training set including conversations between crowdworkers playing those roles .
Different from ConvAI2 , included are emotes and actions grounded within the game world ( e.g. picking up and giving objects ) .
As such , it measures the ability of a conversational agent to ground its discussion on a dynamic environment .
ELI5 ELI5 involves long-form question answering grounded on multiple retrieved documents in order to answer common questions which people ask on the popular ELI5 subreddit .
As such , the answers are in a conversational form applicable to a dialogue agent .
Ubuntu Lowe et al. ( 2015 ) built a dataset that involves in - depth discussions in solving Ubuntu problems .
This studies the ability of an agent on a very focused single topic , and is also a standard benchmark in the field .
Twitter
We use a variant of Twitter discussions ( text-only ) , which have been used in many existing studies , e.g. Sordoni et al . ( 2015 ) ; See et al . ( 2019 ) .
This data naturally involves everyday discussions about topics that people care about .
The public forum makes them different from the more personal discussions of some of the other tasks .
This is the second largest dataset in the collection , and we thus measure in experiments its ability to help performance on other tasks .
pushshift .io Reddit
We use a variant of Reddit discussions ( text-only ) , which has also been used in several existing studies , see e.g.
Yang et al. ( 2018 ) ; Mazar ?
et al. ( 2018 ) ; Keskar et al . ( 2019 ) .
Following , we use a previously existing Reddit dataset extracted and obtained by a third party and made available on pushshift . io , training to generate a comment conditioned on the full thread leading up to the comment , spanning 2200 M training examples .
This is the largest dataset in the collection - much larger than the others .
The subreddits cover a vast range of topics , and hence this is a strong candidate for helping improve performance on other tasks via pre-training and multi-tasking .
Note this dataset does not overlap with ELI5 .
Image Chat Shuster et al. ( 2018 ) collected a crowdsourced dataset of human-human conversations about an image with a given personality , where the goal is to engage the other speaker .
As such , it covers natural conversational responses , including displays of emotion and humor .
Image Grounded Conversations ( IGC ) IGC ( Mostafazadeh et al. , 2017 ) similarly involves two speakers discussing an image , here focusing on questions and responses .
It only includes a validation and test set , and so we converted most of the validation set to form a small training set .
Evaluation Metrics
For all tasks , we use the following metrics : perplexity ( PPL ) , BLEU , ROUGE - 1 , -2 and - L and F1 , and also pick the metric most used in the literature as that subtask 's ' Score ' to compare to existing work .
Multi-tasking
As we are interested in building a single conversational agent , we measure the ability of multi-tasked models that can perform all twelve tasks at once .
Single -Task Fine-tuning
We can still compare such multi-tasked models to single - task fine-tuned baselines to assess if we have gained or lost performance .
Like other works ( Liu et al. , 2015 ; Raffel et al. , 2019 ) we also consider a multi-task followed by finetune setup in order to see if this produces better models .
The latter tests if multi-tasking still proves useful in the single - task setting .
Zero-shot Transfer Finally , we consider a leaveone- out zero-shot setting whereby training is constrained to be on all the training data except for the task being evaluated .
This evaluates the performance on truly new unseen tasks , an important behavior given there are always new tasks .
3 Related Work
Existing Models and Results
Where possible , we have tried to track the best existing results for each task and provided a comparison in our final results table .
As ConvAI2 was a competition , a number of competitors built strong models on it .
The best results were obtained by large pre-trained transformers ( Dinan et al. , 2020 ) .
In particular , Wolf et al . ( 2019 b ) pre-trained via the method of Radford et al . ( 2018 ) using the BooksCorpus dataset , resulting in the best perplexities and F1 scores .
Since then , results have gotten even better with the advent of better and larger pretraining ( Lewis et al. , 2019 ) , which we compare to here ; the same work also reports strong results on ELI5 .
He et al. ( 2019 ) recently obtained strong results on the DailyDialog and Cornell Movie tasks in terms of perplexity by pre-training on 10 % of CC - NEWS ( Bakhtin et al. , 2019 ) , thus using 100 million sentences ( 2.7 billion words ) and then finetuning a transformer based model with a multi-task strategy .
Overall , large pre-trained transformers indeed provide strong existing results on many of the tasks .
Several large language modeling projects have been undertaken in order to show prowess in multi-tasking ability ( Radford et al. , 2019 ; Keskar et al. , 2019 ) , and transformer - based approaches have been adapted to language and vision tasks as well ( Lu et al. , 2019 ; Tan and Bansal , 2019 ; Li et al. , 2019a ; Shuster et al. , 2018 ) .
As well as citing the relevant papers ' results where possible in the experiments section , we also train a BERTbased ( Devlin et al. , 2019 ) generative model as an additional baseline .
Related Tasks and Collections
In the interests of feasibility , there are tasks we did not include in dodecaDialogue .
For example , there are additional knowledge tasks ( Qin et al. , 2019 ; Moghe et al. , 2018 ; Gopalakrishnan et al. , 2019 ) and image- based datasets ( Das et al. , 2017 ) one could use .
There are also a large number of QA tasks we did not include , e.g. Rajpurkar et al. ( 2016 ) ; Choi et al . ( 2018 ) .
In general , our choices were made based on tasks that after training might produce an engaging dialogue agent that humans naturally would want to talk to - which means either natural datasets or crowdsourced datasets where crowdworkers were encouraged to engage one another .
As computational resources and ambitions scale , it would be interesting to add more tasks as well , while retaining the twelve we have chosen here in order to continue to evaluate their success , whilst extending the scope of the entire system .
All the subtasks in the collection we use here already exist .
Other research projects have also built such collection - based tasks before as well .
In particular , the NLP decathlon ( McCann et al. , 2018 ) , from which the name of this paper is inspired , collects together a diverse set of NLP tasks - from sentiment detection to parsing .
Talmor and Berant ( 2019 ) collect a set of 10 QA datasets and build MULTIQA .
Recently , ( Raffel et al. , 2019 ) also similarly multi-tasked a large set of NLP tasks , on an even bigger scale .
Our work differs from these in that it is focused on dialogue tasks which naturally group together to form a conversational agent .
4 Models BERT baseline .
We implement a generative baseline using BERT via adapting the model using a standard auto-regressive loss .
We concatenate both the context and current generation and provide these as input to the model , using BERT 's sentence embeddings to distinguish the roles in the network .
Although BERT is trained to predict masked tokens , we find that fine-tuning can easily adjust its behavior to predicting the next token .
Our BERT baseline is roughly equivalent to the model of Wolf et al . ( 2019 b ) , but does not have a classification loss term .
The implementation relies on HuggingFace Transformers ( Wolf et al. , 2019a ) .
We thus finetune this model for each of our tasks , except Image Chat and IGC which require images as input .
Image + Seq2Seq .
We use a modification of a transformer Seq2Seq architecture ( Vaswani et al. , 2017 ) , additionally adding image features to the encoder .
Our model is a 8 layer encoder , 8 layer decoder with 512 dimensional embeddings and 16 attention heads , and is based on the ParlAI implementation ( Miller et al. , 2017 ) .
We use BPE following via lower - cased Wikipedia , Toronto Books , and Open Subtitles with 30 k merges , giving 54,940 terms .
Reported perplexities are computed with this dictionary .
For image features , we use the pre-trained image features from the ResNeXt-IG - 3.5B model , a ResNeXt 32 x 48d architecture ( Xie et al. , 2017 ) described by Mahajan et al . ( 2018 ) .
This model was previously used successfully for the Image Chat task in Shuster et al . ( 2018 ) .
The final encoding from the ResNeXt model is a vector of size 2048 ; we then use a linear layer to project into the same size as the text encoding , and add it as an extra token at the end of the transformer 's encoder output , then feed them all into the decoder .
During fine- tuning we train the text transformer , but leave the image encoding fixed , apart from finetuning the linear projection .
The text transformer is fine-tuned with a standard auto-regressive negative log-likelihood ( NLL ) loss , following usual sequence to sequence training schemes .
Our best models are available at https :// parl.ai / projects / dodecadialogue .
Experiments Task Training
We employ the ParlAI framework ( Miller et al. , 2017 ) for training on single tasks and for multi-tasking , as many of the tasks are already implemented there , along with a ( multitask ) training and evaluation framework for such models .
Pre-training As pushshift .
io Reddit and ( to some extent )
Twitter are much larger than our other tasks , we try pre-training the Seq2Seq module of our Image + Seq2Seq networks with those datasets , before multi-tasking on all of the tasks , or for evaluating single task fine-tuning .
For Reddit , the model was trained to generate a comment conditioned on the full thread leading up to the comment .
Comments containing URLs or that were under 5 characters in length were removed from the corpus , as were all child comments .
Comments were truncated to 1024 BPE tokens .
The model was trained with a batch size of 3072 sequences for approximately 3 M updates using a learning rate of 5e - 4 , and an inverse square root scheduler .
This took approximately two weeks using 64 NVIDIA V100s .
We note that our transformer pre-training only includes text , while our image encoder was pre-trained separately in previous work ( Mahajan et al. , 2018 ) .
Learning how to combine these sources occurs during fine-tuning .
Model C o n v A I 2 W i z . o f W i k i p
It is important to note that , while compute-heavy , pre-training was conducted exactly once , and all of the subsequent fine -tuning is significantly faster to run .
Transfer Performance between Tasks
We first perform a preliminary study on a subset of the tasks : Reddit , ConvAI2 , Wizard of Wikipedia and Empathetic Dialogues , and report the transfer ability of training on some of them , and testing on all of them ( using the validation set ) , reporting perplexity .
The results are reported in Table 3 .
They show that training on pushshift .
io Reddit alone , a huge dataset , is effective at transfer to other tasks , but never as effective as fine-tuning on the task itself .
Moreover , fine - tuning on most of the smaller tasks actually provides improvements over pushshift .
io Reddit training alone at transfer , likely because the three tasks selected are more similar to each other than to pushshift .
io Reddit .
Finally , training on all four tasks is the most effective strategy averaged over all tasks compared to any other single model , although this does not beat switching between different fine -tuned models on a per-task basis .
Comparison of Pre-training + Fine-tuning strategies Across all 12 tasks , we compare several pre-training strategies : using BERT , no pretraining at all , only initializing via fastText ( Joulin et al. , 2017 ) , and using Twitter and pushshift .
io Reddit pre-training with our Image + Seq2Seq architecture .
For each variant we tune the learning rate , layers , number of heads and embedding size , with less pre-training typically requiring smaller capacity models .
We then only fine-tune on a single task in these experiments , and report perplexity for that task alone , over all 12 tasks .
The results are given in Table 2 , reporting results on the validation set 1 .
The results show a clear reduction in perplexity with more pre-training , as expected .
This is most easily seen by the dodecaScore ( last row ) that is the mean perplexity over all 12 tasks , which decreases from 49.5 ( from scratch models ) down to 17.1 with pushshift .
io Reddit pre-training .
FastText ( 45.7 ) and Twitter ( 35.6 ) initializations help , but nowhere near as much .
BERT fares better , but still is clearly 1 We choose not to use the test set here as we report so many numbers , we do not want to overuse it .
worse than pushshift .
io Reddit pre-training .
The hypothesis here is that pushshift .
io Reddit yields much more effective transfer as it is a dialogue task like our others , whereas non-dialogue corpora such as Wikipedia are not .
This was previously observed for retrieval models in .
Note that we do not report results for the image dialogue tasks for BERT as that architecture does not deal with images .
Finally , as pushshift .
io Reddit is so effective , we also compare to pushshift .
io Reddit training only , with no fine- tuning at all across all tasks , similar to our initial study in Table 3 .
The performance is impressive , with some tasks yielding lower perplexity than BERT pre-training + single task finetuning .
However , it still lags significantly behind fine-tuning applied after pushshift .
io Reddit pretraining .
Image and Knowledge Grounding Some of our tasks involve grounding on knowledge or images .
To show such grounding helps , we report results with and without grounding on those tasks in Table 4 , reporting perplexity .
Particularly for Wizard of Wikipedia ( knowledge ) and Image Chat ( images ) such grounding has a clear effect .
Multi-Task Results
Next , we perform multitask training across all tasks , which is our ultimate goal in order to obtain an open-domain conversational agent .
We optimize over the same set of 11.9 9.9 12.0 8.2 Table 7 : Test performance for various metrics on the dodecaDialogue tasks comparing our multi-task and multitask + fine -tuned methods to existing approaches ( cited ) .
Dashes mean metric was not provided .
* was reported on validation only .
Score is defined on a per-task basis in the metric column .
hyperparameters as before , including multi-tasking weights for tasks , where one samples during training with differing probabilities , and we choose the best model by performing early stopping on the average performance across all tasks .
In this way , we treat all 12 tasks as a single task , and thus during test time it is the model 's responsibility to understand how to respond from the context ( image / dialogue ) itself .
In the end we did not obtain clear improvements beyond pre-training with pushshift .
io Reddit and then equally sampling from all tasks .
We report that final model 's validation performance in terms of perplexity in Table 2 ( second to last column , " All Tasks MT " ) .
It achieves a dodecaScore of 19.1 , superior to all pre-train fine-tune approaches except pushshift .
io Reddit pre-training followed by finetuning , and is also superior to a single pushshift .
io Reddit model .
However , comparing across tasks , while most are close to the corresponding best finetuned model , many are just slightly worse .
This is an expected result and is often reported in multitask systems ( Raffel et al. , 2019 ) .
We look upon this result as both positive - we can obtain a single model doing well on all tasks , which a fine-tuned model cannot - whilst also remaining a challenge to the community : can one find architectures that leverage multi-tasking even better ?
Multi-Task followed by Fine-Tuning As also performed in Liu et al .
( 2015 ) ; Raffel et al. ( 2019 ) we can try to train in a multi-task manner on all tasks , before fine- tuning on a single task , and build a separate model performing this procedure for all tasks , in an attempt to improve single task results further .
Using this approach , one is free to perform hyperparameter search differently for each task .
Here , we found that applying relative task up-weighting during multi-tasking training made a clear difference to the final quality of the fine-tuned target task model , see Table 5 .
Generally , better results come from assigning most of the multi-task weight towards the task itself to be fine-tuned .
Using such an approach we can get marginally better results than fine-tuning alone , although the differences are generally small .
The final best models per task are shown compared to other approaches in Table 2 ( third to last column , " MT All Tasks + FT Single Task " ) .
The final validation dodecaScore is 16.8 , only slightly below 17.1 for fine-tuning .
Decoding Strategies
So far , we have only been measuring perplexity , but we are actually interested in generation , which requires us to decode .
We consider several standard approaches : greedy , beam search ( with beam size , and minimum and maximum output length 2 hyperparameters ) , beam search with beam blocking ( blocking n-grams , we use n = 3 ) ( Paulus et al. , 2018 ) and nucleus sampling ( with parameter p ) ( Holtzman et al. , 2019 ) .
We show the effect of these choices in Table 6 for ConvAI2 and Wizard of Wikipedia ( WoW ) .
Final Systems
The final test performance for our best multi-task and fine-tuned ( via multi- task followed by fine- tuning ) systems are reported in Table 7 ( right ) , with more detailed results with all decoding - based metrics , and validation as well as test performance in Appendix A. Here , for the multi-task model we have fine - tuned the decoding hyperparameters per task .
For results with a single set of decoding hyperparameters , see also Appendix A .
We generally find across all metrics a similar story as before when comparing the finetuning with multi-tasking : multi-tasking is successful , but the challenge is still to do better .
Comparison to Existing Systems
We compare to existing state - of - the - art results previously published for each task .
Results are given in Table 7 .
As existing works report different metrics per task , we report perplexity where possible ( but note , they may be computed on a different dictionary ) , and choose the sequence decoding - based metric that is commonly reported per task ( listed in column ' Metric ' ) , where the ' Score ' column reports its value .
We compare these to our best fine-tuned and multitasked models .
Our multi-task model outperforms all available existing results , with 2 of the 12 tasks having no previous result .
It is only surpassed by our fine-tuned model which also outperforms all available existing results .
Overall , our methods set a strong challenge to future approaches .
Human Evaluation
In addition to automatic metrics , we perform human evaluation on two of the tasks to assess the abilities of our All Tasks MT conversational agent : the knowledge grounding task Wizard of Wikipedia ( WoW ) and the image grounding task Image Chat .
We follow the same evaluation protocols as in ; Shuster et al . ( 2018 ) , comparing our method to the existing approaches referenced in Table 7 .
This involves collecting 100 human- bot conversations for WoW using crowdworkers , involving 8- 10 turns each , across seen topics ( seen in the training set ) and unseen topics , and 500 image - based responses for Image Chat .
A separate set of crowdworkers are then used to compare models pairwise following the ACUTE - Eval procedure of ( Li et al. , 2019 b ) , where they are asked to choose which is " the more engaging response " for Image Chat ( 1500 trials ) and " Who would you prefer to talk to for a long conversation ? " for WoW ( 400 trials ) .
The results , given in Figure 1 , show our method outperforming the existing state of the art generative models on all three comparisons : Image Chat , WoW seen topics and WoW unseen topics .
All three results are statistically significant ( binomial test , p < .05 ) .
Additional details and results breakdown are given in Appendix Section B. Example Outputs
We show some example outputs of our multi-task model for some of the tasks in Appendix C .
Our model is able to leverage im - ages , knowledge , and given personality attributes to produce engaging dialogue with a large amount of variety , depending on the situation .
Leave-One-Out Zero - Shot Performance
Last , but not least , we evaluate the performance of a multi-task model at zero-shot transfer to a new dialogue task .
This is performed by training on all but one of the tasks , and reporting performance on the left out one , repeating this experiment for all tasks .
Our best performing models in that regard are reported in Table 2 ( last column ) .
First , it is reassuring that the overall scores are reasonable , outperforming a pushshift .
io Reddit only model on every task except pushshift .
io Reddit itself .
This means that multi-tasking across many tasks helps transfer learning .
However , the gap between zeroshot performance and multi-task or fine-tuning performance means there is still a significant challenge in improving these results .
Finally , we believe that reporting results in this regime in addition to multitasking results may help avoid the temptation to " cheat " at multi-tasking by trying to detect the task and then apply a separate fine- tuned classifier , as presumably that approach will not truly leverage reasoning and skills between tasks , which transfer may help measure .
Discussion
We have introduced the dodecaDialogue task , and provide strong baseline results leveraging multimodal Image + Seq2Seq transformers trained across all tasks .
The goal of introducing this task is not just as another challenge dataset , but to further motivate building and evaluating conversational agents capable of multiple skills - one of the core goals of AI .
We believe current systems are closer to that goal than ever before - but we also still have a long way to go .
Recently reported results show systems can be reasonably competitive compared to humans in particular domains for short conversations ( Li et al. , 2019 b ; Shuster et al. , 2018 ) .
This work tries to bridge the gap to avoid agents with niche skills , to move towards evaluating an open-domain set of skills .
Still , despite leveraging 12 tasks , there are many skills not included in our set .
For example , longer conversations involving memory ( Moon et al. , 2019 ) , or mixing open-domain conversation with task oriented goals .
Future work should consider adding these tasks to the ones used here , while continuing the quest for improved models .
A Additional Results
MT
B Human Evaluation Further Details
We provide additional results from our human evaluations described in Section 5 .
In Figure 1 , we compare our All Tasks MT Image + Seq2Seq model to existing baselines from both tasks ; to produce those outputs , we used beam search with a beam size of 10 and tri-gram blocking .
As with our experiments regarding automatic metrics , we additionally explored nucleus sampling , with parameter p = 0.7 , and compared to both the baseline models as well as human outputs .
In tables 12 , 13 , and 14 , we show the full results of comparing various models both to each other and also to humans .
When collecting the model-human chats for Wizard of Wikipedia , we additionally asked the humans for a rating from 1 - 5 at the end of each conversation , to indicate the quality of the model 's responses ; we compare these Likert ratings to that of , which followed the same protocol , in Table 15 .
The findings are similar to the pairwise ACUTE - Eval results in the main paper .
