SemEval - 2016
Task 5 : Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis
abstract
This paper describes the SemEval 2016 shared task on Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis ( ABSA ) , a continuation of the respective tasks of 2014 and 2015 .
In its third year , the task provided 19 training and 20 testing datasets for 8 languages and 7 domains , as well as a common evaluation procedure .
From these datasets , 25 were for sentence - level and 14 for text- level ABSA ; the latter was introduced for the first time as a subtask in SemEval .
The task attracted 245 submissions from 29 teams .
Introduction
Many consumers use the Web to share their experiences about products , services or travel destinations ( Yoo and Gretzel , 2008 ) .
Online opinionated texts ( e.g. , reviews , tweets ) are important for consumer decision making ( Chevalier and Mayzlin , 2006 ) and constitute a source of valuable customer feedback that can help companies to measure satisfaction and improve their products or services .
In this setting , Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis ( ABSA ) - i.e. , mining opinions from text about specific entities and their aspects ( Liu , 2012 ) - can provide valuable insights to both consumers and businesses .
An ABSA * * Corresponding author : mpontiki@ilsp.gr . method can analyze large amounts of unstructured texts and extract ( coarse - or fine- grained ) information not included in the user ratings that are available in some review sites ( e.g. , Fig. 1 ) .
Sentiment Analysis ( SA ) touches every aspect ( e.g. , entity recognition , coreference resolution , negation handling ) of Natural Language Processing ( Liu , 2012 ) and as Cambria et al . ( 2013 ) mention " it requires a deep understanding of the explicit and implicit , regular and irregular , and syntactic and semantic language rules " .
Within the last few years several SA - related shared tasks have been organized in the context of workshops and conferences focus-ing on somewhat different research problems ( Seki et al. , 2007 ; Seki et al. , 2008 ; Seki et al. , 2010 ; Mitchell , 2013 ; Nakov et al. , 2013 ; Rosenthal et al. , 2014 ; Pontiki et al. , 2014 ; Rosenthal et al. , 2015 ; Ghosh et al. , 2015 ; Pontiki et al. , 2015 ; Mohammad et al. , 2016 ; Recupero and Cambria , 2014 ; Ruppenhofer et al. , 2014 ; Loukachevitch et al. , 2015 ) .
Such competitions provide training datasets and the opportunity for direct comparison of different approaches on common test sets .
Currently , most of the available SA - related datasets , whether released in the context of shared tasks or not ( Socher et al. , 2013 ; Ganu et al. , 2009 ) , are monolingual and usually focus on English texts .
Multilingual datasets ( Klinger and Cimiano , 2014 ; Jim?nez-Zafra et al. , 2015 ) provide additional benefits enabling the development and testing of crosslingual methods ( Lambert , 2015 ) .
Following this direction , this year the SemEval ABSA task provided datasets in a variety of languages .
ABSA was introduced as a shared task for the first time in the context of SemEval in 2014 ; SemEval - 2014 Task 4 1 ( SE - ABSA14 ) provided datasets of English reviews annotated at the sentence level with aspect terms ( e.g. , " mouse " , " pizza " ) and their polarity for the laptop and restaurant domains , as well as coarser aspect categories ( e.g. , " food " ) and their polarity only for restaurants ( Pontiki et al. , 2014 ) . SemEval -2015 Task 12 2 ( SE - ABSA15 ) built upon SE - ABSA14 and consolidated its subtasks into a unified framework in which all the identified constituents of the expressed opinions ( i.e. , aspects , opinion target expressions and sentiment polarities ) meet a set of guidelines and are linked to each other within sentence - level tuples ( Pontiki et al. , 2015 ) .
These tuples are important since they indicate the part of text within which a specific opinion is expressed .
However , a user might also be interested in the overall rating of the text towards a particular aspect .
Such ratings can be used to estimate the mean sentiment per aspect from multiple reviews ( McAuley et al. , 2012 ) .
Therefore , in addition to sentence - level annotations , SE - ABSA16 3 accommodated also text - level ABSA annotations and provided the respective training and testing data .
Fur-thermore , the SE-ABSA15 annotation framework was extended to new domains and applied to languages other than English ( Arabic , Chinese , Dutch , French , Russian , Spanish , and Turkish ) .
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows : the task set- up is described in Section 2 .
Section 3 provides information about the datasets and the annotation process , while Section 4 presents the evaluation measures and the baselines .
General information about participation in the task is provided in Section 5 .
The evaluation scores of the participating systems are presented and discussed in Section 6 .
The paper concludes with an overall assessment of the task .
Task Description
The SE-ABSA16 task consisted of the following subtasks and slots .
Participants were free to choose the subtasks , slots , domains and languages they wished to participate in .
Subtask 1 ( SB1 ) : Sentence-level ABSA .
Given an opinionated text about a target entity , identify all the opinion tuples with the following types ( tuple slots ) of information : ? Slot1 : Aspect Category .
Identification of the entity E and attribute A pairs towards which an opinion is expressed in a given sentence .
E and A should be chosen from predefined inventories 4 of entity types ( e.g. , " restaurant " , " food " ) and attribute labels ( e.g. , " price " , " quality " ) .
?
Slot2 : Opinion Target Expression ( OTE ) .
Extraction of the linguistic expression used in the given text to refer to the reviewed entity E of each E#A pair .
The OTE is defined by its starting and ending offsets .
When there is no explicit mention of the entity , the slot takes the value " null " .
The identification of Slot2 values was required only in the restaurants , hotels , museums and telecommunications domains .
?
Slot3 : Sentiment Polarity .
Each identified E#A pair has to be assigned one of the following polarity labels : " positive " , " negative " , " neutral " ( mildly positive or mildly negative ) .
An example of opinion tuples with Slot1 - 3 values from the restaurants domain is shown below : " Their sake list was extensive , but we were looking for Purple Haze , which was n't listed but made for us upon request ! " ? { cat : " drinks#style_options " , trg : " sake list " , fr : " 6 " , to : " 15 " , pol : " positive " } , { cat : " service # general " , trg : " null " , fr : " 0 " , to : " 0 " , pol : " positive " } .
The variable cat indicates the aspect category ( Slot1 ) , pol the polarity ( Slot3 ) , and trg the ote ( Slot2 ) ; f r , to are the starting / ending offsets of ote .
Subtask 2 ( SB2 ) : Text- level ABSA .
Given a customer review about a target entity , the goal was to identify a set of { cat , pol} tuples that summarize the opinions expressed in the review .
cat can be assigned the same values as in SB1 ( E# A tuple ) , while pol can be set to " positive " , " negative " , " neutral " , or " conflict " .
For example , for the review text " The So called laptop Runs to Slow and I hate it !
Do not buy it !
It is the worst laptop ever " , a system should return the following opinion tuples : { cat : " laptop # general " , pol : " negative " } , { cat : " laptop#operation_performance " , pol : " negative " } . Subtask 3 ( SB3 ) : Out-of-domain ABSA .
In SB3 participants had the opportunity to test their systems in domains for which no training data was made available ; the domains remained unknown until the start of the evaluation period .
Test data for SB3 were provided only for the museums domain in French .
Datasets
Data Collection and Annotation
A total of 39 datasets were provided in the context of the SE- ABSA16 task ; 19 for training and 20 for testing .
The texts were from 7 domains and 8 languages ; English ( en ) , Arabic ( ar ) , Chinese ( ch ) , Dutch ( du ) , French ( fr ) , Russian ( ru ) , Spanish ( es ) and Turkish ( tu ) .
The datasets for the domains of restaurants ( rest ) , laptops ( lapt ) , mobile phones ( phns ) , digital cameras ( came ) , hotels ( hote ) and museums ( muse ) consist of customer reviews , whilst the telecommunication domain ( telc ) data consists of tweets .
A total of 70790 manually annotated ABSA tuples were provided for training and testing ; 47654 sentencelevel annotations ( SB1 ) in 8 languages for 7 domains , and 23136 text - level annotations ( SB2 ) in 6 languages for 3 domains .
Table 1 provides more information on the distribution of texts , sentences and annotated tuples per dataset .
The rest , hote , and lapt datasets were annotated at the sentence - level ( SB1 ) following the respective annotation schemas of SE - ABSA15 ( Pontiki et al. , 2015 ) .
Below are examples 5 of annotated sentences for the aspect category " service # general " in en ( 1 ) , du ( 2 ) , fr ( 3 ) , ru ( 4 ) , es ( 5 ) , and tu ( 6 ) for the rest domain and in ar ( 7 ) for the hote domain :
1 . Service was slow , but the people were friendly .
? { trg : " Service " , pol : " negative " } , { trg : " people " , pol : " positive " }
2 . Snelle bediening en vriendelijk personeel moet ook gemeld worden !! ? { trg : " bediening " , pol : " positive " } , { trg : " personeel " , pol : " positive " }
3 . Le service est impeccable , personnel agr? able .
? {trg : " service " , pol : " positive " } , { trg : " personnel " , pol : " positive " }
4 . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? , ? ? , ? ? , ? ? ?. ? { trg : " ? " , pol : " neutral " } 5 .
Tambi?n la rapidez en el servicio .
? { trg : " servicio " , pol : " positive " } 6 . Servisi h?zl ?
valesi var . ? {trg : " Servisi " , pol : " positive " }
7 . .. ? ? ? ? ? ? { trg : ? " ? " ? , pol : " positive " }
The lapt annotation schema was extended to two other domains of consumer electronics , came and phns .
Examples of annotated sentences in the lapt ( en ) , phns ( du and ch ) and came ( ch ) domains are shown below : 1 . It is extremely portable and easily connects to WIFI at the library and elsewhere .
? { cat : " laptop# portability " , pol : " positive " } , { cat : " laptop# connectivity " , pol : " positive " }
2 . Apps starten snel op en werken vlot , internet gaat prima .
? { cat : " software#operation_performance " , pol : " positive " } , { cat : " phone # connectivity " , pol : " positive " }
5
The offsets of the opinion target expressions are omitted .
3 . ? ?{ cat : " display # quality " , pol : " positive " }
4 . ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? { cat : " camera# portability " , pol : " positive " }
In addition , the SE- ABSA15 framework was extended to two new domains for which annotation guidelines were compiled : telc for tu and muse for fr .
Below are two examples : 1 . # Internet kopuyor s?rekli :( @turkcell ? { cat : " internet # coverage " , trg : " Internet " , pol : " positive " }
2 . 5 ? pour les ? tudiants , ? a vaut le coup .
? { cat : " museum# prices " , " null " , " positive " }
The text-level ( SB2 ) annotation task was based on the sentence - level annotations ; given a customer review about a target entity ( e.g. , a restaurant ) that included sentence - level annotations of ABSA tuples , the goal was to identify a set of { cat , pol} tuples that summarize the opinions expressed in it .
This was not a simple summation / aggregation of the sentence - level annotations since an aspect may be discussed with different sentiment in different parts of the review .
In such cases the dominant sentiment had to be identified .
In case of conflicting opinions where the dominant sentiment was not clear , the " conflict " label was assigned .
In addition , each review was assigned an overall sentiment label about the target entity ( e.g. , " restaurant # general " , " laptop# general " ) , even if it was not included in the sentence - level annotations .
Annotation Process
All datasets for each language were prepared by one or more research groups as shown in Table 2 .
The en , du , fr , ru and es datasets were annotated using brat ( Stenetorp et al. , 2012 ) , a web-based annotation tool , which was configured appropriately for the needs of the task .
The tu datasets were annotated using a customized version of turksent ( Eryigit et al. , 2013 ) , a sentiment annotation tool for social media .
For the ar and the ch data in - house tools 6 were used .
Below are some further details about the annotation process for each language .
English .
The SE-ABSA15 ( Pontiki et al. , 2015 ) training and test datasets ( with some minor corrections ) were merged and provided for training ( rest and lapt domains ) .
New data was collected and annotated from scratch for testing .
In a first phase , the rest test data was annotated by an experienced 7 linguist ( annotator A ) , and the lapt data by 5 undergraduate computer science students .
The resulting annotations for both domains were then inspected and corrected ( if needed ) by a second expert linguist , one of the task organizers ( annotator B ) .
Borderline cases were resolved collaboratively by annotators A and B. Arabic .
The hote dataset was annotated in repeated cycles .
In a first phase , the data was annotated by three native Arabic speakers , all with a computer science background ; then the output was validated by a senior researcher , one of the task organizers .
If needed ( e.g. when inconsistencies were found ) they were given back to the annotators .
Chinese .
The datasets presented by Zhao et al . ( 2015 ) were re-annotated by three native Chinese speakers according to the SE- ABSA16 annotation schema and were provided for training and testing ( phns and came domains ) .
Dutch .
The rest and phns datasets ( De Clercq and Hoste , 2016 ) were initially annotated by a trained linguist , native speaker of Dutch .
Then , the output was verified by another Dutch linguist and disagreements were resolved between them .
Fi-7
Also annotator for SE - ABSA14 and 15 .
nally , the task organizers inspected collaboratively all the annotated data and corrections were made when needed .
French .
The train ( rest ) and test ( rest , muse ) datasets were annotated from scratch by a linguist , native speaker of French .
When the annotator was not confident , a decision was made collaboratively with the organizers .
In a second phase , the task organizers checked all the annotations for mistakes and inconsistencies and corrected them , when necessary .
For more information on the French datasets consult Apidianaki et al . ( 2016 ) . Russian .
The rest datasets of the SentiRuEval - 2015 task ( Loukachevitch et al. , 2015 ) were automatically converted to the SE- ABSA16 annotation schema ; then a linguist , native speaker of Russian , checked them and added missing information .
Finally , the datasets were inspected by a second linguist annotator ( also native speaker of Russian ) for mistakes and inconsistencies , which were resolved along with one of the task organizers .
Spanish .
Initially , 50 texts ( 134 sentences ) from the whole available data were annotated by 4 annotators .
The inter-anotator agreement ( IAA ) in terms of F - 1 was 91 % for the identification of OTE , 88 % for the aspect category detection ( E# A pair ) , and 80 % for opinion tuples extraction ( E# A , OTE , polarity ) .
Provided that the IAA was substantially high for all slots , the rest of the data was divided into 4 parts and each one was annotated by a different native Spanish speakers ( 2 linguists and 2 software engineers ) .
Subsequently , the resulting annotations were validated and corrected ( if needed ) by the task organizers .
Turkish .
The telc dataset was based on the data used in ( Y?ld ?r? m et al. , 2015 ) , while the rest dataset was created from scratch .
Both datasets were annotated simultaneously by two linguists .
Then , one of the organizers validated / inspected the resulting annotations and corrected them when needed .
Datasets Format and Availability Similarly to SE-ABSA14 and SE - ABSA15 , the datasets 8 of SE - ABSA16 were provided in an XML format and they are available under specific license terms through META - SHARE 9 , a repository devoted to the sharing and dissemination of language resources ( Piperidis , 2012 ) .
Evaluation Measures and Baselines
The evaluation ran in two phases .
In the first phase ( Phase A ) , the participants were asked to return separately the aspect categories ( Slot1 ) , the OTEs ( Slot2 ) , and the { Slot1 , Slot2 } tuples for SB1 .
For SB2 the respective text - level categories had to be identified .
In the second phase ( Phase B ) , the gold annotations for the test sets of Phase A were provided and participants had to return the respective sentiment polarity values ( Slot3 ) .
Similarly to SE - ABSA15 , F- 1 scores were calculated for Slot1 , Slot2 and { Slot1 , Slot2 } tuples , by comparing the annotations that a system returned to the gold annotations ( using micro-averaging ) .
For Slot1 evaluation , duplicate occurrences of categories were ignored in both SB1 and SB2 .
For Slot2 , the calculation for each sentence considered only distinct targets and discarded " null " targets , since they do not correspond to explicit mentions .
To evaluate sentiment polarity classification ( Slot3 ) in Phase B , we calculated the accuracy of each system , defined as the number of correctly predicted polarity labels of the ( gold ) aspect categories , divided by the total number of the gold aspect categories .
Furthermore , we implemented and provided baselines for all slots of SB1 and SB2 .
In particular , the SE- ABSA15 baselines that were implemented for the English language ( Pontiki et al. , 2015 ) , were adapted for the other languages by using appropriate stopword lists and tokenization functions .
The baselines are briefly discussed below : SB1 - Slot1 : For category ( E# A ) extraction , a Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) with a linear kernel is trained .
In particular , n unigram features are extracted from the respective sentence of each tuple that is encountered in the training data .
The category value ( e.g. , " service # general " ) of the tuple is used as the correct label of the feature vector .
Similarly , for each test sentence s , a feature vector is built and the trained SVM is used to predict the probabilities of assigning each possible category to s ( e.g. , { " service # general " , 0.2 } , { " restaurant # general " , 0.4 } .
Then , a threshold 10 t is used to decide which of the categories will be assigned 11 to s .
As features , we use the 1,000 most frequent unigrams of the training data excluding stopwords .
SB1 - Slot2 : The baseline uses the training reviews to create for each category c ( e.g. , " service # general " ) a list of OTEs ( e.g. , " service # general " ? { " staff " , " waiter " } ) .
These are extracted from the ( training ) opinion tuples whose category value is c .
Then , given a test sentence s and an assigned category c , the baseline finds in s the first occurrence of each OTE of c's list .
The OTE slot is filled with the first of the target occurrences found in s .
If no target occurrences are found , the slot is assigned the value " null " .
SB1 - Slot3 : For polarity prediction we trained a SVM classifier with a linear kernel .
Again , as in Slot1 , n unigram features are extracted from the respective sentence of each tuple of the training data .
In addition , an integer-valued feature 12 that indicates the category of the tuple is used .
The correct label for the extracted training feature vector is the corresponding polarity value ( e.g. , " positive " ) .
Then , for each tuple { category , OTE } of a test sentence s , a feature vector is built and classified using the trained SVM .
SB2 - Slot1 :
The sentence - level tuples returned by the SB1 baseline are copied to the text level and duplicates are removed .
Lang. / Slot1 Slot2 { Slot1 , Slot2 } Slot3 Dom. F-1 F-1 F-1 Acc. EN /
SB2 - Slot3 : For each text - level aspect category c the baseline traverses the predicted sentence - level tuples of the same category returned by the respective SB1 baseline and counts the polarity labels ( positive , negative , neutral ) .
Finally , the polarity label with the highest frequency is assigned to the textlevel category c.
If there are no sentence - level tuples for the same c , the polarity label is determined based on all tuples regardless of c .
The baseline systems and evaluation scripts are implemented in Java and are available for download from the SE- ABSA16 website 13 .
The LibSVM package 14 ( Chang and Lin , 2011 ) is used for SVM training and prediction .
The scores of the baselines 13 http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task5/index.
php?id=data-and-tools 14 http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/ in the test datasets are presented in Section 6 along with the system scores .
Participation
The task attracted in total 245 submissions from 29 teams .
The majority of the submissions ( 216 runs ) were for SB1 .
The newly introduced SB2 attracted 29 submissions from 5 teams in 2 languages ( en and sp ) .
Most of the submissions ( 168 ) were runs for the rest domain .
This was expected , mainly for two reasons ; first , the rest classification schema is less fine- grained ( complex ) compared to the other domains ( e.g. , lapt ) .
Secondly , this domain was supported for 6 languages enabling also multilingual or language - agnostic approaches .
The remaining submissions were distributed as follows : 54 in lapt , 12 in phns , 7 in came and 4 in hote .
An interesting observation is that , unlike SE - ABSA15 , Slot1 ( aspect category detection ) attracted significantly more submissions than Slot2 ( OTE extraction ) ; this may indicate a shift towards conceptlevel approaches .
Regarding participation per language , the majority of the submissions ( 156/245 ) were for en ; see more information in Table 5 .
Most teams ( 20 ) submitted results only for one language ( 18 for en and 2 for ru ) .
Of the remaining teams , 3 submitted results for 2 languages , 5 teams submitted results for 3 - 7 languages , while only one team participated in all languages .
Evaluation Results
The evaluation results are presented in Tables 3 ( SB1 : rest-en ) , 4 ( SB1 : rest-es , fr , ru , du , tu & hote - ar ) , 6 ( SB1 : lapt , came , phns ) , and 7 ( SB2 ) 15 .
Each participating team was allowed to submit up to two runs per slot and domain in each phase ; one constrained ( C ) , where only the provided training data could be used , and one unconstrained ( U ) , where other resources ( e.g. , publicly available lexica ) and additional data of any kind could be used for training .
In the latter case , the teams had to report the resources used .
Delayed submissions ( i.e. , runs submitted after the deadline and the release of the gold annotations ) are marked with " * " .
As revealed by the results , in both SB1 and SB2 the majority of the systems surpassed the baseline by a small or large margin and , as expected , the unconstrained systems achieved better results than the constrained ones .
In SB1 , the teams with the highest scores for Slot1 and Slot2 achieved similar F- 1 scores ( see Table 3 ) in most cases ( e.g. , en / rest , es / rest , du /rest , fr/rest ) , which shows that the two slots have a similar level of difficulty .
However , as expected , the { Slot1 , Slot2 } scores were significantly lower since the linking of the target expressions to the corresponding aspects is also required .
The highest scores in SB1 for all slots ( Slot1 , Slot2 , { Slot1 , Slot2 } , Slot3 ) were achieved in the en/rest ; this is probably due to the high participation and to the lower complexity of the rest annotation schema compared to the other domains .
If we compare the results for SB1 and SB2 , we notice that the SB2 scores for Slot1 are significantly higher ( e.g. , en / lapt , en / rest , es / rest ) even though the respective annotations are for the same ( or almost the same ) set of texts .
This is due to the fact that it is easier to identify whether a whole text discusses an aspect c than finding all the sentences in the text discussing c .
On the other hand , for Slot3 , the SB2 scores are lower ( e.g. , en/ rest , es / rest , ru/rest , en / lapt ) than the respective SB1 scores .
This is mainly because an aspect may be discussed at different points in a text and often with different sentiment .
In such cases a system has to identify the dominant sentiment , which usually is not trivial .
Conclusions
In its third year , the SemEval ABSA task provided 19 training and 20 testing datasets , from 7 domains and 8 languages , attracting 245 submissions from 29 teams .
The use of the same annotation guidelines for domains addressed in different languages gives the opportunity to experiment also with crosslingual or language - agnostic approaches .
In addition , SE - ABSA16 included for the first time a text - level subtask .
Future work will address the creation of datasets in languages and domains the enrichment of the annotation schemas with other types of SA - related information like topics , events and figures of speech ( e.g. , irony , metaphor ) .
