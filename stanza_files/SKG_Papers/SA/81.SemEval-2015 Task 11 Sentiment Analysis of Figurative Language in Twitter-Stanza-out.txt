SemEval - 2015 Task 11 : Sentiment Analysis of Figurative Language in Twitter
abstract
This report summarizes the objectives and evaluation of the SemEval 2015 task on the sentiment analysis of figurative language on Twitter ( Task 11 ) .
This is the first sentiment analysis task wholly dedicated to analyzing figurative language on Twitter .
Specifically , three broad classes of figurative language are considered : irony , sarcasm and metaphor .
Gold standard sets of 8000 training tweets and 4000 test tweets were annotated using workers on the crowdsourcing platform CrowdFlower .
Participating systems were required to provide a fine- grained sentiment score on an 11 - point scale ( - 5 to + 5 , including 0 for neutral intent ) for each tweet , and systems were evaluated against the gold standard using both a Cosinesimilarity and a Mean-Squared - Error measure .
Introduction
The limitations on text length imposed by microblogging services such as Twitter do nothing to dampen our willingness to use language creatively .
Indeed , such limitations further incentivize the use of creative devices such as metaphor and irony , as such devices allow strongly - felt sentiments to be expressed effectively , memorably and concisely .
Nonetheless , creative language can pose certain challenges for NLP tools that do not take account of how words can be used playfully and in original ways .
In the case of language using figurative devices such as irony , sarcasm or metaphor - when literal meanings are discounted and secondary or extended meanings are intentionally profiled - the affective polarity of the literal meaning may differ significantly from that of the intended figurative meaning .
Nowhere is this effect more pronounced than in ironical language , which delights in using affirmative language to convey critical meanings .
Metaphor , irony and sarcasm can each sculpt the affect of an utterance in complex ways , and each tests the limits of conventional techniques for the sentiment analysis of supposedly literal texts .
Figurative language thus poses an especially significant challenge to sentiment analysis systems , as standard approaches anchored in the dictionarydefined affect of individual words and phrases are often shown to be inadequate in the face of indirect figurative meanings .
It would be convenient if such language were rare and confined to specific genres of text , such as poetry and literature .
Yet the reality is that figurative language is pervasive in almost any genre of text , and is especially commonplace on the texts of the Web and on social media platforms such as Twitter .
Figurative language often draws attention to itself as a creative artifact , but is just as likely to be viewed as part of the general fabric of human communication .
In any case , Web users widely employ figures of speech ( both old and new ) to project their personality through a text , especially when their texts are limited to the 140 characters of a tweet .
Natural language researchers have attacked the problems associated with figurative interpretations at multiple levels of linguistic representation .
Some have focused on the conceptual level , of which the text is a surface instantiation , to identify the schemas and mappings that are implied by a figure of speech ( see e.g. Veale and Keane ( 1992 ) ; Barnden ( 2008 ) ; Veale ( 2012 ) ) .
These approaches yield a depth of insight but not a robustness of analysis in the face of textual diversity .
More robust approaches focus on the surface level of a text , to consider word choice , syntactic order , lexical properties and affective profiles of the elements that make up a text ( e.g. Rosso ( 2012 , 2014 ) ) .
Surface analysis yields a range of discriminatory features that can be efficiently extracted and fed into machine - learning algorithms .
When it comes to analyzing the texts of the Web , the Web can also be used as a convenient source of ancillary knowledge and features .
Veale and Hao ( 2007 ) describe a means of harvesting a commonsense knowledge - base of stereotypes from the Web , by directly targeting simile constructions of the form " as X as Y " ( e.g. " as hot as an oven " , " as humid as a jungle " , " as big as a mountain " , etc. ) .
Though largely successful in their efforts , Veale and Hao were surprised to discover that up to 20 % of Web-harvested similes are ironic ( examples include " as subtle as a freight train " , " as tanned as an Irishman " , " as sober as a Kennedy " , " as private as a park bench " ) .
Initially filtering ironic similes manually - as irony is the worst kind of noise when acquiring knowledge from the Web - Hao & Veale ( 2010 ) report good results for an automatic , Web-based approach to distinguishing ironic from non-ironic similes .
Their approach exploits specific properties of similes and is thus not directly transferrable to the detection of irony in general .
Reyes , Rosso and Veale ( 2013 ) and Reyes , Rosso and Buscaldi ( 2012 ) thus employ a more general approach that applies machine learning algorithms to a range of structural and lexical features to learn a robust basis for detecting humor and irony in text .
The current task is one that calls for such a general approach .
Note that the goal of Task 11 is not to detect irony , sarcasm or metaphor in a text , but to perform robust sentiment analysis on a finegrained 11 - point scale over texts in which these kinds of linguistic usages are pervasive .
A system may find detection to be a useful precursor to analysis , or it may not .
We present a description of Task 11 in section 2 , before presenting our dataset in section 3 and the scoring functions in section 4 .
Descriptions of each participating system are then presented in section 5 , before an overall evaluation in reported in section 6 .
The report then concludes with some general observations in section 7 .
Task Description
The task concerns itself with the classification of overall sentiment in micro-texts drawn from the micro-blogging service Twitter .
These texts , called tweets , are chosen so that the set as a whole contains a great deal of irony , sarcasm or metaphor , so no particular tweet is guaranteed to manifest a specific figurative phenomenon .
Since irony and sarcasm are typically used to criticize or to mock , and thus skew the perception of sentiment toward the negative , it is not enough for a system to simply determine whether the sentiment of a given tweet is positive or negative .
We thus use an 11 point scale , ranging from - 5 ( very negative , for tweets with highly critical meanings ) to + 5 ( very positive , for tweets with flattering or very upbeat meanings ) .
The point 0 on this scale is used for neutral tweets , or those whose positivity and negativity cancel each other out .
While the majority of tweets will have sentiments in the negative part of the scale , the challenge for participating systems is to decide just how negative or positive a tweet seems to be .
So , given a set of tweets that are rich in metaphor , sarcasm and irony , the goal is to determine whether a user has expressed a positive , negative or neutral sentiment in each , and the degree to which this sentiment has been communicated .
Dataset Design and Collection Even humans have difficulty in deciding whether a given text is ironic or metaphorical .
Irony can be remarkably subtle , while metaphor takes many forms , ranging the dead to the conventional to the novel .
Sarcasm is easier for humans to detect , and is perhaps the least sophisticated form of nonliteral language .
We sidestep problems of detection by harvesting tweets from Twitter that are likely to contain figurative language , either because they have been explicitly tagged as such ( using e.g. the hashtags # irony , # sarcasm , # not , # yeahright ) or because they use words commonly associated with the use of metaphor ( ironically , the words " literally " and " virtually " are reliable markers of metaphorical intent , as in " I literally want to die " ) .
Datasets were collected using the Twitter4 j API ( http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html), which supports the harvesting of tweets in real-time using search queries .
Queries for hashtags such as # sarcasm , # sarcastic and # irony , and for words such as " figuratively " , yielded our initial corpora of candidate tweets to annotate .
We then developed a Latent Semantic Analysis ( LSA ) model to extend this seed set of hashtags so as to harvest a wider range of figurative tweets ( see Li. et. al. , 2014 ) .
This tweet dataset was collected over a period of 4 weeks , from June 1 st to June 30 th , 2014 .
Though URLs have been removed from tweets , all other content , including hashtags - even those used to retrieve each tweet - has been left in place .
Tweets must contain at least 30 characters when hashtags are not counted , or 40 characters when hashtags are counted .
All others are eliminated as too short .
Dataset Annotation on an 11 - point scale A trial dataset , consisting of 1025 tweets , was first prepared by harvesting tweets from Twitter users that are known for their use of figurative language ( e.g. comedians ) .
Each trial tweet was annotated by seven annotators from an internal team , three of whom are native English speakers , the other four of whom are competent non-native speakers .
Each annotator was asked to assign a score ranging from - 5 ( for any tweets conveying disgust or extreme discontent ) to + 5 ( for tweets conveying obvious joy and approval or extreme pleasure ) , where 0 is reserved for tweets in which positive and negative sentiment is balanced .
Annotators were asked to use ?5 , ?3 and ?1 as scores for tweets calling for strong , moderate or weak sentiment , and to use ?4 and ?2 for tweets with nuanced sentiments that fall between these gross scores .
An overall sentiment score for each tweet was calculated as a weighted average of all 7 annotators , where a double weighting was given to native English speakers .
Sentiment was assigned on the basis of the perceived meaning of each tweet - the meaning an author presumably intends a reader to unpack from the text - and not the superficial language of the tweet .
Thus , a sarcastic tweet that expresses a negative message in language that feigns approval or delight should be marked with a negative score ( as in " I just love it when my friends throw me under the bus . " ) .
Annotators were explicitly asked to consider all of a tweet 's content when assigning a score , including any hashtags ( such as # sarcasm , # irony , etc. ) , as participating systems are expected to use all of the tweet 's content , including hashtags .
Tweets of the training and test datasetscomprising 8000 and 4000 tweets respectivelywere each annotated on a crowd-sourcing platform , CrowdFlower.com , following the same annotation scheme as for the trial dataset .
Some examples of tweets and their ideal scores , given as guidelines to CrowdFlower annotators , are shown in Table 1 .
Scammers tend to give identical or random scores for all units in a task .
To prevent scammers from abusing the task , trial tweets were thus interwoven as test questions for annotators on training and test tweets .
Each annotator was expected to provide judgments for test questions that fall within the range of scores given by the original members of the internal team .
Annotators are dismissed if their overall accuracy on these questions is below 70 % .
The standard deviation std u ( u i ) of all judgments provided by annotator u i also indicates that u i is likely to be a scammer when std u ( u i ) =0 .
Likewise , the standard deviation std t ( t j ) of all judgments given for a tweet t j allows us to judge that annotation A i , j as given by u i for t j is an outlier if : , , avg ( ) ( ) i j i j t j i A A std t ? ? ? >
If 60 % or more of an annotator 's judgements are judged to be outliers in this way then the annotator is deemed a scammer and dismissed from the task .
Each tweet - set was cleaned of all annotations provided by those deemed to be scammers .
After cleaning , each tweet has 5 to 7 annotations .
The ratio of in- range judgments on trial tweets , which was used to detect scammers on the annotation of training and test data , can also be used to assign a reliability score to each annotator .
The reliability of an annotator u i is given by R( u i ) =m
i /n i , where n i is the number of judgments contributed by u i on trial tweets , and m i is the number of these judgments that fall within the range of scores provided by the original annotators of the trial data .
The final sentiment score for tweet S(t j ) is the weighted average of scores given for it , where the reliability of each annotator is used as a weight . , ( ) ( ) ( ) i ij i j i i R u A S t R u ? = ? ?
The weighted sentiment score is a real number in the range [ - 5 ? + 5 ] , where the most reliable annotators contribute most to each score .
These scores were provided to task participants in two CSV formats : tweet - ids mapped to real number scores , and tweet - ids to rounded integer scores .
Tweet Delivery
The actual text of each tweet was not included in the released datasets due to copyright and privacy concerns that are standard for use of Twitter data .
Instead , a was provided for retrieving the text of each tweet given its released tweet - id .
Tweets are a perishable commodity and may be deleted , archived or otherwise made inaccessible over time by their original creators .
To ensure that tweets did not perish in the interval between their first release and final submission , all training and test tweets were re-tweeted via a dedicated account to give them new , non-perishable tweet - ids .
The distributed tweet - ids refer to this dedicated account .
Dataset Statistics
The trial dataset contains a mix of figurative tweets chosen manually from Twitter .
It consists of 1025 tweets annotated by an internal team of seven members .
Table 2 shows the number of tweets in each category .
The trial dataset is small enough to allow these category labels to be applied manually .
The training and test datasets were annotated by CrowdFlower users from countries where English is spoken as a native language .
The 8,000 tweets of the training set were allocated as in Table 3 .
As the datasets are simply too large for the category labels Sarcasm , Irony and Metaphor to be assigned manually , the labels here refer to our expectations of the kind of tweets in each segment of the dataset , which were each collated using harvesting criteria specific to different kinds of figurative language .
To provide balance , an additional category Other was also added to the Test dataset .
Tweets in this category were drawn from general Twitter content , and so were not chosen to capture any specific figurative quality .
Rather , the category was added to ensure the ecological validity of the task , as sentiment analysis is never performed on texts that are wholly figurative .
The 4000 tweets of the Test set were drawn from four categories as in Figure 4 .
Scoring Functions
The Cosine-similarity scoring function represents the gold-standard annotations for the Test dataset as a vector of the corresponding sentiment scores .
The scores provided by each participating system are represented in a comparable vector format , so that the cosine of the angle between these vectors captures the overall similarity of both score sets .
A score of 1 is achieved only when a system provides all the same scores as the human gold-standard .
A script implementing this scoring function was released to all registered participants , who were required in turn to submit the outputs of their systems as a tab-separated file of tweet - ids and integer sentiment scores ( as systems may be based either on a regression or a classification model ) .
A multiplier p cos is applied to all submissions , to penalize any that do not give scores for all tweets .
Thus , cos # submitted -entries # all-entries p = E.g. , a cherry - picking system that scores just 75 % of the test tweets is hit with a 25 % penalty .
Mean-Squared -Error ( MSE ) offers a standard basis for measuring the performance of predictive systems , and is favored by some developers as a basis for optimization .
When calculating MSE , in which lower measures indicate better performance , the penalty - coefficient p MSE is instead given by : # all-entries # submitted -entries MSE p =
Overview of Participating Systems
A total of 15 teams participated in Task 11 , submitting results from 29 distinct runs .
A clear preference for supervised learning methods can be observed , with two types of approach - SVMs and regression models over carefully engineered features - making up the bulk of approaches .
Team UPF used regression with a Random- Sub- Space using M5 P as a base algorithm .
They exploited additional external resources such as SentiWordnet , Depeche Mood , and the American National Corpus .
Team ValenTo used a regression model combined with affective resources such as SenticNet ( see Poria et al. , 2014 ) to assign polarity scores .
Team Elirf used an SVM - based approach , with features drawn from character N-grams ( 2 < N < 10 ) and a bag-of-words model of the tf-idf coefficient of each N-gram feature .
Team BUAP also used an SVM approach , taking features from dictionaries , POS tags and character n-grams .
Team CLaC used four lexica , one that was automatically generated and three than were manually crafted .
Term frequencies , POS tags and emoticons were also used as features .
Team LLT_PolyU used a semi-supervised approach with a Decision Tree Regression Learner , using wordlevel sentiment scores and dependency labels as features .
Team CPH used ensemble methods and ridge regression ( without stopwords ) , and is notable for its specific avoidance of sentiment lexicons .
Team DsUniPi combined POS tags and regular expressions to identify useful syntactic structures , and brought sentiment lexicons and WordNet - based similarity measures to bear on their supervised approach .
Team RGU 's system learnt a sentiment model from the training data , and used a linear Support Vector Classifier to generate integer sentiment labels .
Team ShellFBK also used a supervised approach , extracting grammatical relations for use as features from dependency tree parses .
Team HLT also used an SVM - based approach , using lexical features such as negation , intensifiers and other markers of amusement and irony .
Team KElab constructed a supervised model based on term co-occurrence scores and the distribution of emotion - bearing terms in training tweets .
Team LT3 employed a combined , semi-supervised SVMand regression - based approach , exploiting a range of lexical features , a terminology extraction system and and both WordNet and DBpedia .
Team PRHLT used a deep auto-encoder to extract features , employing both words and character 3 grams as tokens for the autoencoder .
Their best results were obtained with ensembles of Extremely Random Trees with character n-grams as features .
Results and Discussions
For comparison purposes , we constructed three baseline systems , each implemented as a na?ve classifier with shallow bag-of - word features .
The results of these baseline systems for both the MSE and Cosine metrics are shown in Table 5 .
Table 6 shows the results for each participating system using these metrics .
Team CLaC achieves the best overall performance on both , achieving 0.758 on the Cosine metric and 2.117 on the MSE metric .
Most of the other systems also show a clear advantage over the baselines reported in Table 5 .
Scores are for last run submitted for each system .
Baseline
The best performance on sarcasm and irony tweets was achieved by teams LLT_PolyU and elirf , who ranked 3 rd and 4 th respectively .
Team ClaC came first on tweets in the Metaphor category .
One run of team CPH excelled on the Other ( non-figurative ) category , but scored poorly on figurative tweets .
Most teams performed well on sarcasm and irony tweets , but the Metaphor and Other categories prove more of a challenge .
Table 7 presents the Spearman 's rank correlation between the ranking of a system overall , on all tweet categories , and its ranking of different categories of tweets .
The right column limits this analysis to the top 10 systems .
When we consider all systems , their performance on each category of tweet is strongly correlated to their overall performance .
However , looking only at the top 10 performing systems , we see a strikingly strong correlation between performance overall and performance on the category Metaphor .
Performance on Metaphor tweets is a bellwether for performance on figurative language overall .
Then category
Other also plays an important role here .
Both the trail data and the training datasets are heavily biased to negative sentiment , given their concentration of ironic and sarcastic tweets .
In contrast , the distribution of sentiment scores in the test data is more balanced due to the larger proportion of Metaphor tweets and the addition of non-figurative Other tweets .
To excel at this task , systems must not treat all tweets as figurative , but learn to spot the features that cause figurative devices to influence the sentiment of a tweet .
Summary and Conclusions
This paper has described the design and evaluation of Task 11 , which concerns the determination of sentiment in tweets which are likely to employ figurative devices such as irony , sarcasm and metaphor .
The task was constructed so as to avoid questions of what specific device is used in which tweet : a glance at Twitter , and the use of the # irony hashtag in particular , indicates that there are as many folk theories of irony as there are users of the hashtag # irony .
Instead , we have operationalized the task to put it on a sound and more ecologically valid footing .
The effect of figurativity in tweets is instead measured via an extrinsic task : measuring the polarity of tweets that use figurative language .
The task is noteworthy in its use of an 11 - point sentiment scoring scheme , ranging from - 5 to + 5 .
The use of 11 fine- grained categories precludes the measurement of inter-annotator agreement as a reliable guide to annotator / annotation quality , but it allows us to measure system performance on a task and a language type in which negativity dominates .
We expect the trial , training and test datasets will prove useful to future researchers who wish to explore the complex relation between figurativity and sentiment .
To this end , we have taken steps to preserve the tweets used in this task , to ensure that they do not perish through the actions of their original creators .
