Supervised Methods for Aspect- Based Sentiment Analysis
abstract
In this paper , we present our contribution in SemEval2014 ABSA task , some supervised methods for Aspect - Based Sentiment Analysis of restaurant and laptop reviews are proposed , implemented and evaluated .
We focus on determining the aspect terms existing in each sentence , finding out their polarities , detecting the categories of the sentence and the polarity of each category .
The evaluation results of our proposed methods exhibit a significant improvement in terms of accuracy and f-measure over all four subtasks regarding to the baseline proposed by SemEval organisers .
Introduction
The increasing amount of user-generated textual data has increased the need of efficient techniques for analysing it .
Sentiment Analysis ( SA ) has become more and more interesting since the year 2000 ( Liu 2012 ) , many techniques in Natural Language Processing have been used to understand the expressed sentiment on an entity .
Many levels of granularity have been also distinguished : Document Level SA considers the whole document is about an entity and classifies whether the expressed sentiment is positive , negative or neutral ; Sentence Level SA determines the sentiment of each sentence , some works have been done on Clause Level SA but they are still not enough ; Entity or Aspect - Based SA performs finer- grained analysis in which all entities and This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Licence .

Aspect - Based SA task consists of several subproblems , the document is about many entities which could be for example a restaurant , a laptop , a printer .
Users may refer to an entity by different writings but normally there are not a lot of variations to indicate the same entity , each entity has many aspects which could be its parts or attributes , some aspects could be another entity such as screen of laptop , but most works did not take this case into account .
Therefore , we could define the opinion by the quintuple ( Liu 2012 ) ( e i , a ij , s ijkl , h k , t l ) where e i is the entity i , a ij are the aspects of the entity i , s ijkl is the expressed sentiment on the aspect at the time t l , h k the holder which created the document or the text .
This definition does not take into account that the entity has aspects that could have also other aspects which leads to an aspect hierarchy , in order to avoid this information loss , few works have handled this issue , they proposed to represent the aspect as a tree of aspect terms ( Wei and Gulla 2010 ; Kim , Zhang et al. 2013 ) .
Supervised and unsupervised methods have been used for handling this task , in this paper , we propose supervised methods and test them over two datasets related to laptop reviews and restaurant reviews provided by the ABSA task of SemEval2014 ( Pontiki , Galanis et al. 2014 )
The same model proposed for aspect term polarity detection has been adopted .
Related works Several methods concerning the ABSA have been proposed , some of them are supervised , and others unsupervised .
The earliest work on aspect detection from on -line reviews presented by Hu and Liu used association rule mining based on Apriori algorithm to extract frequent noun phrases as product features , they used two seed sets of 30 positive and negative adjectives , then WordNet has been used to find and add the seed words synonyms .
Infrequent aspects had been processed by finding the noun related to an opinionated word ( Hu and Liu 2004 ) . Opinion Digger ( Moghaddam and Ester 2010 ) used also Apriori algorithm to extract the frequent aspects then it filters the non-aspects by applying a constraint - learned from the training data -on the extracted aspects .
KNN algorithm is applied to estimate the aspect rating scaling from 1 to 5 stands for ( Excellent , Good , Average , Poor , Terrible ) , assuming that the sentiment is expressed by the nearest adjectives to the aspect term in the sentence segment , WordNet is used for finding the synonyms of sentiment word in order to use them to estimate the distance between it and the words of rating scale .
Some unsupervised methods based on LDA ( Latent Dirichlet allocation ) were proposed .
Brody and Elhadad used LDA to find the aspects , determined the number of topics by applying a clustering method ( Brody and Elhadad 2010 ) , then they used a similar method proposed by Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown ( Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown 1997 ) to extract the conjunctive adjectives but not the disjunctive due to the specificity of the domain , seed sets were used and assigned scores , these scores were propagated using propagation method through the aspect-sentiment graph building from the pairs of aspect and related adjectives .
Other works make one LDA based model for the aspect and sentiment extraction .
Lin and He ( Lin and He 2009 ) proposed Joint model of Sentiment and Topic ( JST ) which extends the stateof - the - art topic model , Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) by adding a sentiment layer , this model is fully unsupervised and it can detect sentiment and topic simultaneously .
Wei and Gulla ( Wei and Gulla 2010 ) modelled the hierarchical relation between product aspects .
They defined SOT Sentiment Ontology
Tree to formulate the knowledge of hierarchical relationships among product attributes and tackle the problem of sentiment analysis as a hierarchical classification problem .
Unsupervised hierarchical aspect Sentiment model ( HASM ) was proposed by Kim et al ( Kim , Zhang et al. 2013 ) to discover a hierarchical structure of aspect-based sentiments from unlabelled online reviews .
Supervised methods uses normally a CRF or HMM models .
Jin and Ho ( Jin and Ho 2009 ) applied a lexicalized HMM model to extract aspects using the words and their part- of-speech tags in order to learn a model , then unsupervised algorithm for determining the aspect sentiment using the nearest opinion word to the aspect and taking into account the polarity reversal words ( such as not ) .
CRF model was used by Jakob and Gurevych ( Jakob and Gurevych 2010 ) with these features : tokens , POS tags , syntactic dependency ( if the aspect has a relation with the opinionated word ) , word distance ( the distance between the word in the closest noun phrase and the opinionated word ) , and opinion sentences ( each token in the sentence containing an opinionated expression is labelled by this feature ) , the input of this method is also the opinionated expressions , they use these expressions for predicting the aspect sentiment using the dependency parsing for retrieving the pair aspect-expression from the training set .
Our method for aspect extraction is closed to ( Jakob and Gurevych 2010 ) , where we used CRF model with different features for aspect extraction , but another method for sentiment detection .
The second and fourth subtasks are concerning the polarity detection , so besides to all previous discussed works , we can handle them as sentence level SA .
We choose to use Multinomial Naive Bayes with some features ( POS , Z-score , prepolarity ) .
The most related work is ( Hamdan , B?chet et al. 2013 ) where they used Naive Bays with WordNet , DBpedia and SentiWordNet features .
The System
Our system is composed of four subtasks :
Subtask1 : Aspect Terms Extraction
The objective of this subtask is to extract all aspect terms in the review sentence , aspect terms could be a word or multiple words .
For this purpose we have used CRF ( Conditional Random Field ) which have been used for information extraction .
We choose the IOB notation , therefore we distinguish the terms at the Beginning , the Inside and the Outside of aspect term expression .
Then , we propose 16 features , for each term we extract the following features : - Its root ( Porter Stemmer ) ; - Its POS tag ; - The stemming roots for all three words before and after the term ; - The POS tags for all three words before and after the term ; - A feature indicates if the word starts with capital letter ; - A feature indicates if the word is capitalised .
For example , for this review " But the staff was so horrible to us . "
Where staff is the aspect term , the target of each word will be : But :O the :O staff : B was :O so:O horrible : O to :O us :O .
Subtask2 : Aspect Term Polarity Detection
This subtask can be seen as sentence level or phrase level sentiment Analysis , the first step ( 1 ) we should detect the context or the words related to the aspect term , then to compute its polarity according to these words .
Dependency parsing could be used to determine these words or simple distance function .
We extract the context of aspect term according to the syntax and other aspect terms .
Therefore , the context is the term itself and all the surrounding terms enclosed between two separators ( commas in general ) , if another aspect is also enclosed by these separators we consider it as a separator instead of the comma , and we do not take the terms after it or before it ( according to its direction to the aspect term ) .
If the sentence has only an aspect term the separators will be the beginning and the end of the sentence .
For example , for this review " It took half an hour to get our check , which was perfect since we could sit , have drinks and talk ! " where we have two aspect terms drinks and check , the context of check will be " It took half an hour to get our check " and the context of drinks will be " have drinks and talk ! " .
Another example , " All the money went into the interior decoration , none of it went to the chefs . "
The context for interior decoration will be " All the money went into the interior decoration " and the context for chefs will be " none of it went to the chefs " .
The second step ( 2 ) we should determine the polarity , which could be positive , negative , neutral or conflict .
We propose to use Multinomial Naive - Bayes for learning a classifier based on different features : - The terms in the sentence ( term frequency ) ;
- The POS features ( the number of adjectives , adverbs , verbs , nouns , connectors )
- The pre-polarity features ( the number of positive and negative words in the sentence extracted from Subjectivity lexicon and Bing Liu's Opinion Lexicon ) ; - Z-score features ( the number of words which have Z-score more than three in each sentiment class ) , Z_score is described in 3.3 .
Subtask3 : Category Detection
Determining the categories of each sentence can be seen as a multi-label classification problem at sentence level .
We propose to use Z-score which is capable of distinguishing the importance of a term in a category .
The more the term is important in a category the more its Z-score is high in this category and low in other categories in which it is not important .
Thus , we compute the Z-score for all terms using the annotated data , then for each given sentence , the sum of Z-score over each category is computed if the Z-score of term in a category is less than zero , we ignore it in this category because it is not important , the sentence will be attributed to the category having the highest Z-score , if some categories have the same Z-scores the sentence will be attributed to the both .
The algorithm steps :
For each tem t in the sentence : For each category c : If z-score ( t , c ) >0 : Z_sc [ c ] + = z-score( t , c ) Categories=max ( Z_sc )
We assume that the term frequency follows the multinomial distribution .
Thus , Z_score can be seen as a standardization of the term frequency .
We compute Z score for each term t i in a class C j ( t ij ) by calculating its term relative frequency tfr ij in a particular class C j , as well as the mean ( mean i ) which is the term probability over the whole corpus multiplied by n j the number of terms in the class C j , and standard deviation ( sd i ) of term ti according to the underlying corpus ( see Eq. ( 1,2 ) ) .
Z = Eq. ( 1 ) Z = * ( ) * ( ) * ( ( ) ) Eq. ( 2 ) Z_score was exploited for SA by ( Zubaryeva and Savoy 2010 ) , they choose a threshold ( Z>2 ) for selecting the number of terms having Z_score more than the threshold , then they used a logistic regression for combining these scores .
We use Z_score as added features for multinomial Naive Bayes classifier .
Subtask4 : Category Polarity Detection
We have used Multinomial Naive -Bayes as in the subtask2 step ( 2 ) with the same features , but the different that we add also the name of the category as a feature .
Thus , for each sentence having n category we add n examples to the training set , the difference between them is the feature of the category .
Experiments and Evaluations
We tested our system using the training and testing data provided by SemEval 2014 ABSA task .
Two data sets were provided ; the first con-tains 3 Ksentences of restaurant reviews annotated by the aspect terms , their polarities , their categories , the polarities of each category .
The second contains of 3 K sentences of laptop reviews annotated just by the aspect terms , their polarities .
The evaluation process was done in two steps .
First step is concerning the subtasks 1 and 3 which involves the aspect terms extraction and category detection , we were provided with restaurant review and laptop review sentences and we had to extract the aspect terms for both data sets and the categories for the restaurant one .
Baseline methods were provided ; Table1 demonstrates the results of these subtasks in terms of precision P , recall R and f-measure F for our system and the baseline 2 .
We remark that our system is 24 % and 21 % above the baseline for aspect terms extraction in restaurant and laptop reviews respectively , and above 3 % for category detection in restaurant reviews .
The second step involves the evaluation of subtask 2 and 4 , we were provided with ( 1 ) restaurant review sentences annotated by their aspect terms , and categories , we had to determine the polarity for each aspect term and category ; ( 2 ) laptop review sentences annotated by aspect terms and we had to determine the aspect term polarity .
Table 2
We remark that our system is 8 % and 13 % above the baseline for aspect terms polarity detection in restaurant and laptop reviews respectively , and 7 % above for category polarity detection in restaurant reviews .
Conclusion
