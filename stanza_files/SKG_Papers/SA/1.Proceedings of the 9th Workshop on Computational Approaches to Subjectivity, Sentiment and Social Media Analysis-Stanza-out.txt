We would like to thank the EMNLP 2018 Organizers and Workshop Chairs for the help and support at the different stages of the workshop organization process .
We are also especially grateful to the Program Committee members and the external reviewers for the time and effort spent assessing the papers .
We would like to extend our thanks to our invited speaker - Dr. Ellen Riloff - for accepting to deliver the keynote talks , opening new horizons for research and applications of sentiment and emotion detection from text .
Introduction Research in automatic Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis ( SSA ) , as subtasks of Affective Computing and Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) , has flourished in the past years .
The growth in interest in these tasks was motivated by the birth and rapid expansion of the Social Web that made it possible for people all over the world to share , comment or consult content on any given topic .
In this context , opinions , sentiments and emotions expressed in Social Media texts have been shown to have a high influence on the social and economic behaviour worldwide .
SSA systems are highly relevant to many real-world applications ( e.g. marketing , eGovernance , business intelligence , social analysis ) and also to many tasks in Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) - information extraction , question answering , textual entailment , to name just a few .
The importance of this field has been proven by the high number of approaches proposed in research in the past decade , as well as by the interest that it raised from other disciplines ( Economics , Sociology , Psychology , Marketing , Crisis Management disciplines ( Economics , Sociology , Psychology , Marketing , Crisis Management , and Behavioral Studies , Digital Humanities ) and the applications that were created using its technology .
Next to the growth in the diversity of applications , task definitions change towards more complex challenges :
Subjectivity , polarity recognition and opinion mining has been enriched with fine- grained aspect and target level predictions .
Polarity as a concept is complemented by emotion models as defined from psychological research .
In spite of the growing body of research in the area in the past years , dealing with affective phenomena in text has proven to be a complex , interdisciplinary problem that remains far from being solved .
Its challenges include the need to address the issue from different perspectives and at different levels , depending on the characteristics of the textual genre , the language ( s ) treated and the final application for which the analysis is done .
The aim of the 9th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity , Sentiment and Social Media Analysis ( WASSA 2018 ) was to continue the line of the previous editions , bringing together researchers in Computational Linguistics working on Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis and researchers working on interdisciplinary aspects of affect computation from text .
This year , we also organized a track on implicit emotion recognition : http://implicitemotions.wassa2018.com/
Participants were given a tweet from which a certain emotion word is removed .
That word is one of the following : " sad " , " happy " , " disgusted " , " surprised " , " angry " , " afraid " or a synonym of one of them .
The task was to predict the emotion the excluded word expresses : Sadness , Joy , Disgust , Surprise , Anger , or Fear .
With this formulation of the task , we provided data instances which are likely to express an emotion .
However , the emotion needs to be inferred from the causal description , which is typically more implicit than an emotion word .
For the main workshop , we accepted 15/60 papers as long ( 25 % ) and another 17 as short , giving a total of 32/60 papers accepted - 53 % .
For the Implicit Emotions Shared Task , we got 19 system description paper submissions , out of which we accept 17 .
49 papers in total will be presented at the workshop , together with the additional contribution from the invited speaker , Dr. Ellen Riloff .
