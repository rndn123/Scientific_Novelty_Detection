UO UA : Using Latent Semantic Analysis to Build a Domain-Dependent Sentiment Resource
abstract
In this paper we present our contribution to SemEval - 2014 Task 4 : Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis ( Pontiki et al. , 2014 ) , Subtask 2 : Aspect Term Polarity for Laptop domain .
The most outstanding feature in this contribution is the automatic building of a domain-depended sentiment resource using Latent Semantic Analysis .
We induce , for each term , two real scores that indicate its use in positive and negative contexts in the domain of interest .
The aspect term polarity classification is carried out in two phases : opinion words extraction and polarity classification .
The opinion words related with an aspect are obtained using dependency relations .
These relations are provided by the Stanford Parser 1 . Finally , the polarity of the feature , in a given review , is determined from the positive and negative scores of each word related to it .
The results obtained by our approach are encouraging if we consider that the construction of the polarity lexicon is performed fully automatically .
Introduction Hundreds of millions of people and thousands of companies around the world , actively use Social Media 2 .
Every day are more amazing websites and applications ( Facebook , Twitter , MySpace , Amazon , etc. ) that allow the easy sharing of information in near real time .
For this reason , at present , the Web is flooded with subjective , personal and affective data .

Nowadays , companies have redirected their marketing strategies toward the Web .
Each one of them advertises that their products are the best , amazing , easy to use , long lasting and cheap .
But are these advertisements really true ?
Obviously , not everything is true .
The companies usually exaggerate the product 's quality and in many cases tend not to advertise the limitations of their products .
Therefore , taking a rational decision about which product is the best among the variety of existing options can be very stressful .
To avoid this situation , frequently we trust in the experiences gained by others who have purchased the product of our interest , or one similar .
The existence of websites like Ciao 3 , Epinions 4 and Cnet 5 make possible to the customers to interchange their experiences about a specific product , and to future clients avoid products advertising However , the existence of a large volume of reviews entails that it is impossible to conduct an effective exploration before making a final decision .
The most important benefit of having that amount of user- generated content on hand , specifically product 's reviews , is that , these data can be explored by a computer system to obtain information about products and their features .
The task of aspect- based sentiment analysis ( Liu , 2012 ) is a fine-grained level of Sentiment Analysis ( Pang and Lee , 2008 ) .
This aim to identify the aspects ( e.g. , battery , screen , food , service , size , weight , time - life ) of given target entities ( e.g. , laptops , restaurants , camera ) and the sentiment expressed towards each aspect ( e.g. , positive , negative , neutral ) .
This are composed by two basic phases : feature extraction and feature polarity classification .
In this paper we present our contribution for SemEval - 2014 Task 4 : Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis ( Pontiki et al. , 2014 ) , Subtask 2 : Aspect Term Polarity .
In this approach we only focus on the polarity classification problem .
For this , we induce a domain-dependent sentiment lexicon applying Latent Semantic Analysis ( LSA ) on product reviews corpus , gathered from Ciao .
The classification phase is carried out as follow : the opinion words related with the product aspect are draw out using the dependency relations provided by Stanford Parser , then the polarity of the extracted words are combined to obtain overall aspect polarity .
The paper is organized as follows .
Section 2 describes our approach .
Further on , in Section 3 , we discuss the results obtained in the SemEval 2014 Task No. 4 subtask 2 . Finally , section 4 provides concluding remarks .
UO UA System
One of major challenge in sentiment analysis into product reviews , is dealing with a quite domain dependence .
For instance , the word " unpredictable " can be considered as positive in Movie domain , however it is very negative in Airplane domain .
For this reason , we propose to create a specific sentiment lexicon for addressing aspect based sentiment analysis in reviews .
Our proposal is divided in two main phases .
The first one aims to build a domain-dependent sentiment resource for Laptop domain applying LSA .
The second phase obtains the words related by means of some dependency relation with the aspect , and later , the polarity of these words are obtained from induced polarity lexicon and combined for computing overall aspect polarity .
Domain-Dependent Polarity Lexicon
The use of sentiment resource has been proven to be useful to build , train , and evaluate systems for sentiment analysis ( Guti?rrez et al. , 2013 ; Balahur , 2011 ) .
In order to build sentiment resource , several approach has been presented .
In one of the first works , presented by ( Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown , 1997 ) , was proposed to take into ac-count if adjectives are linked by adversative or copulative conjunctions for detecting its polarity .
In ( Turney and Littman , 2003 ) the authors exposed a method for inferring the semantic orientation of a word from its statistical association with a set of positive and negative paradigm words , measured by point-wise mutual information ( PMI ) .
In ( 2004 ) , Hu and Liu suggested a technique to expand the lexicon using the relations of synonymy and antonym provided by WordNet ( Fellbaum , 1998 ) .
In ( 2009 ) , Cruz et al. , created a sentiment resource based on a graph , constructed from conjunctive expressions between pairs of adjectives , observed in a review corpus .
PageRank algorithm ( Page et al. , 1999 ) was adapted to be used on graphs with positive and negative edges , in order to obtain the semantic orientation of words .
Despite the wide range of existing proposals for resources construction , the results achieved with them are far from expected .
As we have already seen , in aspect based sentiment analysis , the polarity of a word is heavily dependent on the domain ; and general propose sentiment resource such as General Inquirer ( Stone et al. , 1966 ) , WordNet-Affect ( Strapparava and Valitutti , 2004 ) , SentiWordNet ( Baccianella et al. , 2010 ) or HowNet ( Dong et al. , 2010 ) do not capture this dependency .
On the other hand , the human annotators can not create specific sentiment resources for each new product launched to market .
Therefore , propose methods to create these resources is a challenging task .
In this paper we address this task , presenting a framework for building domain-dependent sentiment resource .
Our proposal is compounded of four phases .
( See figure 1 ) .
Firstly , review pages about the product of interest can be retrieved from different websites , for instance , Ciao , Epinions and Cnet ( in this work we only use reviews from Ciao ) .
This reviews are parsed and cleaned ( this time we use Python XML Parser 6 ) .
For each page we extract : pros , cons , title , full review and rating .
In this work we have only focus on the pros and cons attributes because they are usually very brief , consist of short phrases or sentence segments and give a positive and negative evaluation about the product aspects .
Each pros and cons in remainder paper will be considered as positive and negative samples , respectively .
Subsequently , the samples are preprocessed , applying a POS - Tagging tool ( Padr ? and Stanilovsky , 2012 ) to convert all words in lemmas .
After that , the stopwords are removed from text .
Afterward each sample is represented using the classic vector space model ( Salton et al. , 1975 ) .
Intending to measure the association between term and class we add a special term to the vectors .
In positive samples the term t pos is added whereas in the negative samples the term t neg is aggregated .
Later , we apply a Latent Semantic Analysis ( this time we use , Gensim python package ) to calculate the strength of the semantic association between words and classes .
LSA uses the Singular Value Decomposition ( SVD ) to analyze the statistical relationships among words in a corpus .
The first step is construct a matrix M n?m , in which the row vectors v i represent lemmas and the column vectors s i the positive and negative sample ( pros and cons ) .
In each cell t ij , we have the TF score ( Term Frequency ) of the i th lemma in j th sample .
The next step is apply Singular Value Decomposition to matrix M n?m to decompose it into a product of three matrices U ?V T , then , we select the k largest singular values , and their corresponding singular vectors from U and V , obtained an approximation M = U k ?
k V T k of rank k to original matrix M n?m .
After LSA is performed , we use the new matrix M to measure the association between lemmas l i and l j computing the cosine measure between vectors v i and v j , with the equation 1 .
LSA score ( l i , l j ) = < v i , v j > v i ? v j ( 1 ) Finally , the polarity lexicon contains lemmas l i and its positive and negative scores .
This values are computed using LSA score ( l i , t pos ) and LSA score ( l i , t neg ) respectively .
The table 1 show some top positive and negative words computed with this strategy .
With aim to do our contribution to SemEval - 2014 , Task 4 : Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis ( Pontiki et al. , 2014 ) , Subtask 2 : Aspect Term Polarity , we gathered 3010 Laptop Reviews , from Ciao and create a corpus with 6020 samples , 3010 positives ( Pros ) and 3010 negatives ( Cons ) .
This corpus was used as input in the developed framework ( See figure 1 ) .
In this time we utilize Freeling 7 as POS - Tagging tool and Gensim Python Packages 8 to perform LSA ( only the most 100 most significant eigenvalue are used ) .
After that , a domain-dependent sentiment resource ( DLSR ) with 4482 term was created for Laptop reviews .
Positive
Aspect Polarity Classification
In order to exploit our domain-dependent sentiment resource building for Laptop domain , we develop an unsupervised method based on language rule to classify the product aspect .
The basic rules are used to find dependency relation between aspect and their attributes .
The figure 2 show the architecture of our proposal .
The proposed method receive as input a tuple ( P f eature , R ) , where P f eature represent the aspect to evaluate , and R is the context ( review ) in it appears .
The dependency parsed is applied to review R , using Stanford Parser .
Following that , we extract a set of tuples W , each tuple is represented as a pair ( Att , M od ) where Att is a word related with the aspect P f eature through some dependency relations shown in Table 2 , and M od is a integer value indicating if Att is modified by a valence shifter ( Polanyi and Zaenen , 2004 ) , ( we only consider negation words , e.g. , never , no , not , do n't , nothing , etc. ) , and default value of 0 is assign , in case that , the Att is modified by a valence shifter , we assign value of - 1 .
Once , the set of pairs W was obtained , the polarity of the feature P f eature is determined from the scores of the attributes ( related words ) that describe it .
To sum up , for each pair ( Att , M od ) ?
W , the positive P os (( Att , M od ) ) and negative N eg (( Att , M od ) ) scores are calculated as :
If SO pos is greater than SO neg then the aspect is considered as positive .
On the contrary , if SO pos is less than SO neg the aspect is negative .
Finally , if SO pos is equal to SO neg the aspect is considered as neutral .
N eg (( Att , M od ) ) = ?N ( Att ) if M od < 0 N ( Att ) otherwise (
Results
In this section we present the evaluation of our system in the context of SemEval - 2014 , Task 4 : Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis ( Pontiki et al. , 2014 ) , Subtask 2 : Aspect Term Polarity .
For evaluating the participant 's system two unlabeled domain-specific datasets for laptops and restaurants were distributed .
For each dataset two runs can be submitted , the first ( constrained ) , the system can only be used the provided training data and other resources such as lexicons .
In the second ( unconstrained ) , the system can use additional data for training .
We send one run for laptop dataset and it only use external data retrieved from Ciao website ( the training data was not used ) ( unconstrained ) .
The results achieve by our method are illustrate in Table 3 .
As may be observed , the accuracy Label Pr Rc F1 conflict 0.0 0.0 0.0 negative 0,5234 0,3764 0,4379 neutral 0,4556 0,4074 0,4302 positive 0,6364 0,7561 0,6911 Accuracy 0.55198777 achieve by UA OU was 0.55 , and F1 measure for negative , neutral and positive were 0,4379 , 0,4302 and 0,6911 respectively .
In case of conflict polarity we reached a 0.0 F1 value because our system not handle this situation .
For this subtask ( Laptop domain ) a total of 32 runs was submitted by all systems participant 's and our run was ranked as 25 th .
The results despite not achieving expected , are encouraging .
These evidence the feasibility of building resources from data available on the web , for aspect- based sentiment analysis .
Conclusions
In this article , we presented and evaluated the approach considered for our participation in SemEval - 2014 Task 4 : Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis ( Pontiki et al. , 2014 ) , Subtask 2 : Aspect Term Polarity , specifically for Laptop Domain .
We present a framework for building domaindependent sentiment resources applying Latent Semantic Analysis and build a special resource for polarity classification in Laptop domain .
This resource was combined into unsupervised method to compute the polarity associated to different aspect in reviews .
The results obtained by our approach are encouraging if we consider that the construction of the polarity lexicon is performed fully automatically .
