Multi-Channel Convolutional Neural Network for Twitter Emotion and Sentiment Recognition
abstract
The advent of micro-blogging sites has paved the way for researchers to collect and analyze huge volumes of data in recent years .
Twitter , being one of the leading social networking sites worldwide , provides a great opportunity to its users for expressing their states of mind via short messages which are called tweets .
The urgency of identifying emotions and sentiments conveyed through tweets has led to several research works .
It provides a great way to understand human psychology and impose a challenge to researchers to analyze their content easily .
In this paper , we propose a novel use of a multi-channel convolutional neural architecture which can effectively use different emotion and sentiment indicators such as hashtags , emoticons and emojis that are present in the tweets and improve the performance of emotion and sentiment identification .
We also investigate the incorporation of different lexical features in the neural network model and its effect on the emotion and sentiment identification task .
We analyze our model on some standard datasets and compare its effectiveness with existing techniques .
Introduction Social networking sites ( e.g. , Twitter ) have become immensely popular in the last decade .
User generated content ( e.g. , blog posts , statuses , tweets etc. ) in social media provides a wide range of opinionated , emotional and sentimental content which gives researchers a massive data source to explore .
For example , Twitter , being one of the leading social networking giants , provides an online environment that allows people of various backgrounds and locations to share their opinions and views on different matters .
As of July 2018 , over 500 million tweets are sent per day having over 300 million monthly active users .

There is often a misconception about sentiments and emotions as these subjectivity terms have been used interchangeably ( Munezero et al. , 2014 ) . Munezero et al. ( 2014 ) differentiate these two terms along with other subjectivity terms and provide the computational linguistics community with clear concepts for effective analysis of text .
While sentiment classification tasks deal with the polarity of a given text ( whether a piece of text expresses positive , negative or neutral sentiment ) and the intensity of the sentiment expressed , emotion mining tasks naturally deal with human emotions which in some end purposes are more desirable ( Ren and Quan , 2012 ; Desmet and Hoste , 2013 ; .
Detecting emotion and sentiment from noisy twitter data is really challenging due to its nature .
Tweets tend to be short in length and have a diverse vocabulary making them harder to analyze due to the limited contextual information they contain .
In this study , we are interested in tackling these two tasks with a novel use of a single neural network architecture .
A number of emotion theories are available which suggest different sets of basic emotions .
Interestingly , joy , sadness , anger , fear and surprise are common to all .
To the best of our knowledge , the model suggested by Ekman ( 1999 ) is the most broadly used emotion model .
In this study , we use Ekman 's basic emotions together with other sets of emotions ( Plutchik , 1984 ; Shaver et al. , 1987 ) .
In early textual emotion mining and sentiment analysis research , the usefulness of using external lexicons along with predefined rules has been demonstrated ( Aman and Szpakowicz , 2008 ; Neviarouskaya et al. , 2007 ; Bandhakavi et al. , 2017 ; Thelwall et al. , 2010 ; Gilbert , 2014 ) . Aman and Szpakowicz ( 2008 ) used Roget 's Thesaurus along with WordNet - Affect for fine- grained emotion prediction from blog data .
Bandhakavi et al. ( 2017 ) propose a unigram mixture model ( UMM ) ( 2007 ) propose a rule- based system which can handle informal texts in particular .
They built a database of abbreviations , emoticons , affect words , etc. , in which each entry is labeled with an emotion and its intensity .
Thelwall et al . ( 2010 ) propose an algorithm , SentiStrength , which utilizes a dictionary of sentiment words associated with strength measures to deal with short informal texts from social media .
Gilbert ( 2014 ) propose VADER , a rule- based model for sentiment analysis .
They built a lexicon which is specially attuned to microblog-like contexts and their model outperforms individual human raters .
More recently , deep learning models have proven to be very successful when applied on various text-related tasks ( Kim , 2014 ; Kalchbrenner et al. , 2014 ; dos Santos and Gatti , 2014 ; Tai et al. , 2015 ; Wang et al. , 2016 ; Felbo et al. , 2017 ; Abdul-Mageed and Ungar , 2017 ) . Kim ( 2014 )
The recent success of neural based models motivated us to take a different look at the sentiment and emotion prediction from the noisy twitter data task .
Compared with sequential models , CNN models train relatively faster and seem to work very well on noisy data such as tweets which are grammatically error-prone .
We decided to work with CNN models after our initial experiments suggested that they perform comparatively better than a simple BiLSTM model on twitter dataset .
We address the following questions in this paper : ?
Can CNN models be used in a way that can improve the performance of detecting emotion and sentiment from noisy Twitter data ? ?
How important are hashtag words , emoticons and emojis as predictors of emotion and sentiment in micro-blogging sites ?
How can we encode them in a multi-channel convolutional neural network ? ?
How can we add external features to a CNN model effectively ?
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows :
We describe our model architecture in detail in Section 2 .
In Section 3 , we describe the datasets and lexicons used in our experiments .
As well , we describe the experimental setup required for working with Twitter data .
In Section 4 , we discuss the results from our experiments .
In Section 5 , we discuss our findings with particular attention paid to answering the above questions .
Finally , in Section 6 , we give a summary of our work followed by our remarks on future studies .
Multi-channel CNN Model
We represent the architecture of our model in Fig. 1 .
The model consists of an embedding layer with two channels , a convolution layer with different kernel sizes and multiple filters , a dropout layer for regularization , a max pooling layer , multiple hidden layers and a softmax layer .
We now describe each of these layers in detail .
Embedding Layer
In this layer , two embedding matrices , the Tweet Matrix and the Hash - Emo Matrix , are passed through two different channels of our convolutional neural network .
The first matrix represents a particular tweet .
Each tweet t i consists of a sequence of tokens w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w n i .
L 1 is the maximum tweet length .
The height of the Tweet Matrix is L 1 .
Short tweets are padded using zero padding .
In the Tweet Matrix , every word is represented as a d-dimensional word vector .
Since tweets are usually noisy , short in length , and have different kinds of features other than text , it 's useful to have a word embedding specially trained on a large amount of Tweet data ( Tang et al. , 2014 ) .
Previous research ( Collobert et al. , 2011 ; Socher et al. , 2011 ) has shown the usefulness of using pretrained word vectors to improve the performance of various models .
As a result , in our experiments , we have used the publicly available pre-trained GloVe word vectors for Twitter by ( Pennington et al. , 2014a ) .
The word vectors are trained on 27B word tokens in an unsupervised manner .
In this layer , we also pass another matrix called the Hash - Emo Matrix through a different channel in our network .
This matrix is composed of three different sets of features : hashtags , emoticons and emojis .
These are considered as distinguishable traits to showcase one 's mood ( Zhao et al. , 2012 ) .
People like to use hashtags to express their emotional state through various microblogging sites ( e.g. , Twitter ) ( Qadir and Riloff , 2014 ) .
Also graphical emoticons or emojis can convey strong emotion or sentiment .
So for each tweet t i , we extract hashtags h 1 , h 2 , . . . , h k i and emoticons / emojis e 1 , e 2 , . . . , e p i .
We concatenate the hashtags and emoticon / emoji vectors for each tweet t i to get the Hash - Emo Matrix .
We introduce a hyper-parameter L 2 as a threshold on the height of the Hash - Emo Matrix .
Tweets with the number of hash - emo features less than L 2 are padded with zero while tweets with more hashemo features than L 2 are truncated .
We use word vectors from GloVe with dimension d for hashtags words .
In the case that no word vector is found for a particular word we randomly initialize it .
We also do random initialization of word vectors for emoticons .
For emojis , we first map it to something descriptive ( to be discussed in more detail in Section 3.2 ) and then generate random word vectors .
These word vectors are tuned during the training phase .
Convolutional Layer
In this layer , we apply m filters of varying window sizes over the Tweet Matrix from the embedding layer .
Here , window size ( k ) refers to the number of adjacent word vectors in the Tweet Matrix that are filtered together ( when k > 1 ) .
Sliding our filter down we repeat this for the rest of the word vectors .
Let w i ?
IR d be the d-dimensional word vector corresponding to the i-th word in a tweet .
Also let w i?i+ j denote the concatenation of word vectors w i , w i+ 1 , . . . , w i+j and F ? IR k?d denote the filter matrix .
Thus a feature f i is generated by : f i = F ? w i?i+k?1 + b ( 1 ) where b is a bias term and ? represents the convolution action ( a sum over element- wise multipli-cations ) .
At this stage , we apply a nonlinear activation function such as ReLU ( Nair and Hinton , 2010 ) before passing it through the dropout layer .
We use multiple filters with the same window size in order to learn complementary features from the same window .
Different window sizes ( k ) allow us to extract active local k-gram features .
For the Hash - Emo Matrix , we apply m filters to each vector to generate local unigram features in different scales before passing it to the next layer .
Pooling Layer
In this layer , employing a max-over pooling operation ( Collobert et al. , 2011 ) on the output from the previous layer for each channel extracts the most salient features .
In this way , for each filter , we get the maximum value .
So we get features equal to the number of filters in this stage .
We chose max pooling instead of other pooling schemes because Zhang and Wallace ( 2017 ) showed that max pooling consistently performs better than other pooling strategies for various sentence classification tasks .
Hidden Layers
We concatenate all the feature vectors from the previous layer .
In addition , we concatenate additional sentiment and affect feature vectors ( which are described in detail in Section 3.2 ) as well which forms a large feature vector .
This is then passed through a number of hidden layers .
A nonlinear activation function ( i.e. , ReLU ( Nair and Hinton , 2010 ) ) is applied in each layer before the vector is finally passed through the output layer .
We tried a different activation function ( tanh ) as well , but ReLU worked the best for us .
Output Layer
This is a fully connected layer which maps the inputs to a number of outputs corresponding to the number of classes we have .
For multi-class classification task , we use softmax as the activation function and categorical cross-entropy as the loss function .
The output of the softmax function is equivalent to a categorical probability distribution which generally indicates the probability that any of the classes are true .
For binary classification task , we use sigmoid as the activation function and binary cross-entropy as our loss function .
Experiments
In this section , we describe in detail the datasets and experimental procedures used in our study .
Datasets
We used a number of emotion and sentiment datasets for our experiments .
A description of each dataset is given below : BTD .
Big Twitter Data is an emotion - labeled Twitter dataset provided by Wang et al . ( 2012 ) .
The dataset had been automatically annotated based on the seven emotion category seed words ( Shaver et al. , 1987 ) being a hashtag and the quality of the data was verified by two annotators as described in ( Wang et al. , 2012 ) .
We were only able to retrieve a portion of the original dataset as many tweets were either removed or not available at the time we fetched the data using the Twitter API .
We applied the heuristics from ( Wang et al. , 2012 ) to remove any hashtags from the tweets which belong to the list of emotion seed words .
TEC .
Twitter Emotion Corpus has been published by Mohammad ( 2012 ) for research purposes .
About 21,000 tweets were collected based on hashtags corresponding to Ekman 's ( 1999 ) six basic emotions .
The dataset has been used in related works ( Shahraki and Zaiane , 2017 ; Balahur , 2013 ; . CBET .
The Cleaned Balanced Emotional
Tweet dataset is provided by Shahraki and Zaiane ( 2017 ) .
To the best of our knowledge , this is one of the largest publically available balanced datasets for twitter emotion detection research .
The dataset contains 80,937 tweets with nine emotion categories including Ekman 's six basic emotions .
SE .
The SemEval - 2018 Task 1 - Affect dataset was provided by Mohammad et al . ( 2018 ) .
The SemEval task was to estimate the intensity of a given tweet and its corresponding emotion .
However , in this study , we utilize the labeled dataset only to classify the tweets into four emotion categories and use the training , development and test sets provided in this dataset in our experiments .
STS - Gold .
This dataset was constructed by Saif et al . ( 2013 ) for Twitter sentiment analysis .
The dataset contains a total of 2,034 tweets labeled ( positive / negative ) by three annotators .
This dataset has been extensively used in several works for model evaluation ( Saif et al. , 2014 b ; Krouska et al. , 2017 ; Saif et al. , 2014a ) . STS .
The Stanford Twitter Sentiment dataset was introduced by Go et al . ( 2009 ) .
It consists of a training set and a test set .
The training set contains around 1.6 million tweets , whereas the test set contains 498 tweets .
The training set was built automatically based on several emoticons as potential identifiers of sentiment .
However , the test set was manually annotated and heavily used for model evaluation in related research .
We perform one experiment with all three labels ( positive / negative / neutral ) to compare the performance of different variants of our model and another one with two labels ( positive / negative ) to make comparison with related works ( Jianqiang et al. , 2018 ; dos Santos and Gatti , 2014 ; Go et al. , 2009 ) . SS - Twitter .
The Sentiment Strength Twitter dataset was constructed by Thelwall et al . ( 2012 ) to evaluate SentiStrength .
The tweets were manually labeled by multiple persons .
Each tweet is assigned a number between 1 and 5 for both positive and negative sentiments , 1 represents weak sentiment strength and 5 represents strong sentiment strength .
We followed the heuristics used by Saif et al . ( 2013 ) to obtain a single sentiment label for each tweet , giving us a total of 4 , 242 positive , negative and neutral tweets .
The transformed dataset has been used in other literature ( Go et al. , 2009 ; .
We provide basic statistics of the datasets used in our experiments in Table 1 .
Experimental Setup Data Cleaning .
Twitter data is unstructured and highly informal ( Yoon et al. , 2013 ) and thus it requires a great deal of effort to make it suitable for any model .
NLTK ( Bird and Loper , 2004 ) provides a regular-expression based tokenizer for Twitter , TweetTokenizer , which preserves user mentions , hashtags , urls , emoticons and emojis in particular .
It also reduces the length of repeated characters to three ( i.e. " Haaaaaapy " will become " Haaapy " ) " .
In our experiments , we utilized the TweetTokenizer to tokenize tweets .
To accommodate the pretrained word vectors from ( Pennington et al. , 2014 b ) , we pre-processed each tweet in a number of ways .
We lowercased all the letters in the tweet .
User mentions have been replaced with < user > token ( i.e. @user-name1 will become < user > ) .
In addition , we also removed urls from the tweets as urls do not provide any emotional value .
We also normalized certain negative words ( e.g. , " wo n't " will become " will not " ) .
Using slang words is a very common practice in social media .
We compiled a list of the most common slang words from various online resources 2 and replaced all of the occurrences with their full form ( e.g. , " nvm " will become " never mind " ) .
Our list of slang words does n't contain any word which has multiple meanings .
Usage of certain punctuation is often crucial in social media posts as it helps the user to emphasize certain things .
We found that two punctuation symbols ( ! and ? ) are common among social media users to express certain emotional states .
We kept these symbols in our text and normalized the repetitions ( e.g. , " !!! " will become " ! < repeat > " ) .
The use of emojis and emoticons has increased significantly with the advent of various social media sites .
Emoticons ( e.g. , :- D ) are essentially a combination of punctuation marks , letters and numbers used to create pictorial icons which generally display an emotion or sentiment .
On the other hand , emojis are pictographs of faces , objects and symbols .
The primary purpose of using emojis and emoticons is to convey certain emotions and sentiments ( Dresner and Herring , 2010 ) .
One advantage of using the TweetTokenizer is that it gives us emoticons and emojis as tokens .
Though we use the emoticons as is in our experiment , we utilize a python library called " emoji " to get descriptive details about the pictorial image .
For example , " " represents " smiling face " .
In our experiments , we removed stop-words and replaced numbers occurring in the tweets with the token < number >.
We also stripped off " # " symbols from all the hashtags within the tweets ( e.g. , " # depressed " will become " depressed " ) and used the stripped version of hashtags on the second channel of our model .
We only kept tokens with more than one character .
Input Features .
Along with word embeddings , we used additional affect and sentiment features in our network .
In our experiments , we used a feature vector V f where each value in the vector corresponds to a particular lexical feature ranging between [ 0 , 1 ] .
We utilized a number of publicly available lexicons which are described briefly below to construct the vector .
Warriner et al. ( 2013 ) provides a lexicon consisting of 14,000 English lemmas with valence , arousal and dominance scores .
Three components of emotion are scored for each word between 1 and 9 in this lexicon .
We calculate the average score for each component across all tokens in a tweet and normalize them in the range [ 0 , 1 ] .
Gilbert ( 2014 ) provides a list of lexical features along with their associated sentiment intensity measures .
We use this lexicon to calculate the average of positive , negative , and neutral scores over all the tokens in a tweet .
In addition , we used the NRC Emotion Lexicon provided by Mohammad and Turney ( 2013 ) which consists of a list of unigrams and their association with one of the emotion categories ( anger , anticipation , disgust , fear , joy , sadness , surprise , trust ) .
We use the percentage of tokens belonging to each emotion category as features .
We also used the NRC Affect Intensity Lexicon provided by Mohammad and Bravo-Marquez ( 2017 ) and NRC Hashtag Emotion Lexicon provided by which contain real-valued fine - grained word-emotion association scores for words and hashtag words .
We combined two lexicons MPQA and BingLiu provided by Wilson et al . ( 2005 ) and Hu and Liu ( 2004 ) , respectively , and used them to calculate the percentage of positive and negative tokens belonging to each tweet .
We also used AFINN ( Nielsen , 2011 ) which contains a list of English words rated for valence with an integer between ?5 ( negative ) to + 5 ( positive ) .
We first normalized the scores in the range [ 0,1 ] and then calculated the average of this score over all the tokens in a tweet .
Lastly , we detect the presence of consecutive exclamation ( ! ) and question marks ( ? ) in a tweet and use them as boolean features .
Network Parameters and Training .
Zhang and Wallace ( 2017 ) performed a sensitivity analysis on various parameters of a one- layer CNN model and showed how tuning the parameters can affect the performance of a model .
Inspired by the work done by ( Zhang and Wallace , 2017 ) , we also searched for the optimal parameter configurations in our network .
Table 3 shows different hyperparameter configurations that we tried and the final configuration that was used in our model .
The final configuration was based on both performance and training time .
The embedding dimension has been set to 100 for both channels of our network as it worked best for us among other dimensions .
We also experimented with a different number of fil - ( Saif et al. , 2014 b ) .
B : SentiStrength ( Krouska et al. , 2017 ) . C : SentiCircle with Pivot ( Saif et al. , 2014a ) . D : Deep Convolutional Neural Network ( Jianqiang et al. , 2018 ) . E : Character to Sentence Convolutional Neural Network ( CharSCNN ) ( dos Santos and Gatti , 2014 ) .
F : Maximum Entropy ( Saif et al. , 2013 ) . G : Quantum Language Model + Quantum Relative Entropy . ters and varying kernel sizes .
The combination of kernel sizes , ( k = 1 , 2 , 3 ) in the first channel and k = 1 in the second channel worked the best for us .
We also experimented with various batch sizes and the performance of the model remained reasonably constant , though the training time varied significantly .
In our network , we used three hidden layers .
In addition , we used the Adam optimizer ( Kingma and Ba , 2014 ) and the back - propagation ( Rumelhart et al. , 1986 ) algorithm for training our model .
Keras 2.2.0 was used for implementing the model .
Regularization .
In order to reduce overfitting , it is a common practice to employ regularization strategies in CNNs .
In our experiments , we used dropout regularization ( Srivastava et al. , 2014 ) for both of the channels after the convolutional layer .
We experimented with three different dropout rates as seen in Table 3 and also with no dropout at all .
The model works better when we apply dropouts after the convolutional layer .
Results
In this section , we describe the results obtained in our experiments .
We use precision , recall , F1score and accuracy as our evaluation metrics .
In recent emotion category recognition studies on Twitter data , people tend to construct their own dataset by collecting tweets from Twitter for their experiments .
Hence , it is hard to find a large enough benchmark dataset to compare the performance with other people 's work .
In this study , we experimented with four emotion labeled datasets which have been made publicly available by their authors .
Table 2 shows the results for each emotion category for all of the datasets .
For the BTD dataset , we trained our model with 1 , 136 , 305 tweets , while we used 140 , 979 and 142 , 602 tweets as development and test data respectively .
We used the same training , development and test sets as ( Wang et al. , 2012 ) except that our retrieved dataset contains fewer samples .
We achieved relatively high F1 -scores of 72.6 % , 73.6 % and 76.8 % for joy , sadness and anger , respectively , whereas for surprise we get a low F1 -score of 27.1 % .
This is probably due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset as can be seen in Table 1 .
The number of samples for joy , sadness and anger is much higher than for surprise .
Our model achieves an accuracy of 69.2 % , whereas Wang et al . ( 2012 ) reported an accuracy of 65.6 % when trained on a much larger dataset .
We can not make direct comparison with ( Wang et al. , 2012 ) since we were not able to retrieve the full test set due to the unavailability of some tweets at the time of fetching data from Twitter .
For the TEC dataset , we evaluated our model with 10 - fold cross validation .
Mohammad ( 2012 ) reported an F1 - score of 49.9 % with SVM , whereas our model achieves an F1 -score of 55.6 % .
For the CBET dataset , we used 80 % of the data as the training set and the remaining 20 % as the test set .
We get an average F1 -score of 56.5 % .
We also used 10 fold cross-validation for the SemEval dataset and achieved an F1 -score of 61.3 % .
Tables 5 and 6 show the performance of three variants of our model on the sentiment labeled datasets and the emotion labeled datasets respectively .
The first variant is a basic CNN model without hash - emo embedding or any additional features .
The second variant includes the hashemo embedding , while the last variant combines additional lexical features as well .
It can be observed that when we introduce the second channel with hash - emo embedding , we get a significant increase in accuracy for most of the datasets .
We can see in Table 5 that , for STS - Test and SS - Twitter datasets , we get better F1 - scores for all three sentiment labels when we include the hash - emo embedding along with external lexical features .
In
Discussion
In this study , we have showed the effectiveness of encoding hashtags , emoticons and emojis through a separate channel in a CNN network for emotion and sentiment detection tasks .
Our MC - CNN model with hash - emo embedding performs well when compared to the basic CNN model .
To the best of our knowledge , our model achieves the best accuracies on the three sentiment datasets , and has significant improvement in performance on the four emotion labeled datasets over the basic CNN model .
The results show the importance of hashtags , emoticons and emojis in social media as predictors of emotion and sentiment .
The model performs even better when additional lexical features are introduced into the network .
Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper , we propose a novel use of a multichannel convolutional neural architecture which effectively encodes different types of emotion indicators which are found in social media posts .
Results suggest that encoding the emotion indicators through a separate channel provides significant improvement over the traditional CNN based models .
We also demonstrate a simple approach to incorporate different lexical features in the network giving us comparatively better results when used along with our MC - CNN model .
Our model performs particularly well on two important tasks in social media : emotion detection and sentiment analysis .
This model can be extended to perform other tasks as well .
In future , we would like to explore character embedding as this can give us crucial linguistic features from noisy twitter data .

dos Santos and Gatti ( 2014 ) also experimented with the same dataset with their Character to Sentence CNN model , re- porting an accuracy of 86.4 % .
Lastly , for the SS -
Twitter dataset , our model achieves an accuracy of 79.3 % whereas Zhang et al . ( 2018 ) and Saif et al . ( 2013 ) reported an accuracy of 61.9 % and 73.4 % , respectively .
Table 6 : 6 Comparison of results ( accuracy in % ) of three variants of our model .
? represents the inclusion of Hash - Emo embedding into the network .
? represents the inclusion of external features into the network .
