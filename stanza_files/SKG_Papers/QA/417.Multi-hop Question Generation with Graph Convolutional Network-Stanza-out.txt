Multi-hop Question Generation with Graph Convolutional Network
abstract
Multi-hop Question Generation ( QG ) aims to generate answer-related questions by aggregating and reasoning over multiple scattered evidence from different paragraphs .
It is a more challenging yet under-explored task compared to conventional single - hop QG , where the questions are generated from the sentence containing the answer or nearby sentences in the same paragraph without complex reasoning .
To address the additional challenges in multi-hop QG , we propose Multi-Hop Encoding Fusion Network for Question Generation ( MulQG ) , which does context encoding in multiple hops with Graph Convolutional Network and encoding fusion via an Encoder Reasoning Gate .
To the best of our knowledge , we are the first to tackle the challenge of multi-hop reasoning over paragraphs without any sentence - level information .
Empirical results on HotpotQA dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method , in comparison with baselines on automatic evaluation metrics .
Moreover , from the human evaluation , our proposed model is able to generate fluent questions with high completeness and outperforms the strongest baseline by 20.8 % in the multihop evaluation .
The code is publicly available at https://github.com/HLTCHKUST/MulQG.
Introduction Question Generation ( QG ) is a task to automatically generate a question from a given context and , optionally , an answer .
Recently , we have observed an increasing interest in text - based QG ( Du et al. , 2017 ; Zhao et al. , 2018 ; Scialom et al. , 2019 ; Nema et al. , 2019 ; Zhang and Bansal , 2019 ) .
Most of the existing works on text - based QG focus on generating SQuAD -style ( Rajpurkar et al. , 2016 ; Puri et al. , 2020 ) Question :
What city is the Marine Air Control Group 28 ( Location T ) located in ?
Table 1 : An example of multi-hop QG in the Hot-potQA ( Yang et al. , 2018 ) dataset .
Given the answer is Location H , to ask where is T located , the model needs a bridging evidence to know that T is located in C , and C is located in H ( T ? C ? H ) .
This is done by multi-hop reasoning .
single - hop reasoning Zhao et al. , 2018 ) .
Little effort has been put in multi-hop QG , which is a more challenging task .
Multi-hop QG requires aggregating several scattered evidence spans from multiple paragraphs , and reasoning over them to generate answer-related , factual - coherent questions .
It can serve as an essential component in education systems ( Heilman and Smith , 2010 ; Lindberg et al. , 2013 ; Yao et al. , 2018 ) , or be applied in intelligent virtual assistant systems ( Shum et al. , 2018 ; Pan et al. , 2019 ) .
It can also combine with question answering ( QA ) models as dual tasks to boost QA systems with reasoning ability ( Tang et al. , 2017 ) .
Intuitively , there are two main additional challenges needed to be addressed for multi-hop QG .
The first challenge is how to effectively identify scattered pieces of evidence that can connect the reasoning path of the answer and question ( Chauhan et al. , 2020 ) .
As the example shown in Table 1 , to generate a question asking about " Marine Air Control Group 28 " given only the answer " Havelock , North Carolina " , we need the bridging evidence like " Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point " .
The second challenge is how to reason over multiple pieces of scattered evidence to generate factual - coherent questions .
Previous works mainly focus on single - hop QG , which use neural network based approaches with the sequence - to-sequence ( Seq2Seq ) framework .
Different architectures of encoder and decoder have been designed ( Nema et al. , 2019 ; Zhao et al. , 2018 ) to incorporate the information of answer and context to do single - hop reasoning .
To the best of our knowledge , none of the previous works address the two challenges we mentioned above for multi-hop QG task .
The only work on multi-hop QG ( Chauhan et al. , 2020 ) uses multi-task learning with an auxiliary loss for sentence - level supporting fact prediction , requiring supporting fact sentences in different paragraphs being labeled in the training data .
While labeling those supporting facts requires heavy human labor and is time - consuming , their method cannot be applied to general multi-hop QG cases without supporting facts .
In this paper , we propose a novel architecture named Multi-Hop Encoding Fusion Network for Question Generation ( MulQG ) to address the aforementioned challenges for multi-hop QG .
First of all , it extends the Seq2Seq QG framework from sing -hop to multi-hop for context encoding .
Additionally , it leverages a Graph Convolutional Network ( GCN ) on an answer - aware dynamic entity graph , which is constructed from entity mentions in answer and input paragraphs , to aggregate the potential evidence related to the questions .
Moreover , we use different attention mechanisms to imitate the reasoning procedures of human beings in multihop generation process , the details are explained in Section 2 .
We conduct the experiments on the multi-hop QA dataset HotpotQA ( Yang et al. , 2018 ) with our model and the baselines .
The proposed model outperforms the baselines with a significant improvement on automatic evaluation results , such as BLEU ( Papineni et al. , 2002 ) .
The human evaluation results further validate that our proposed model is more likely to generate multi-hop questions with high quality in terms of Fluency , Answerability and Completeness scores .
Our contributions are summarized as follows : ?
To the best of our knowledge , we are the first to tackle the challenge of multi-hop reasoning over paragraphs without any sentence - level information in QG tasks .
?
We propose a new and effective framework for Multi-hop QG , to do context encoding in multiple hops( steps ) with Graph Convolutional Network ( GCN ) .
?
We show the effectiveness of our method on both automatic evaluation and human evaluation , and we make the first step to evaluate the model performance in multi-hop aspect .
Methodology
The intuition is drawn from human 's multi-hop question generation process ( Davey and McBride , 1986 ) .
Firstly , given the answer and context , we skim to establish a general understanding of the texts .
Then , we find the mentions of entities in or correlated to the answer from the context , and analyse nearby sentences to extract useful evidence .
Besides , we may also search for linked information in other paragraphs to gain a further understanding of the entities .
Finally , we coherently fuse our knowledge learned from the previous steps and start to generate questions .
To mimic this process , we develop our MulQG framework .
The encoding stage is achieved by a novel Multi-hop Encoder .
At the decoding stage , we use maxout pointer decoder as proposed in Zhao et al . ( 2018 ) .
The overview of the framework is shown in Figure 1 .
Multi-hop Encoder Our Multi-hop Encoder includes three modules : ( 1 ) Answer - aware context encoder ( 2 ) GCN - based entity - aware answer encoder ( 3 ) Gated encoder reasoning layer .
The context and answer are split into word- level tokens and denoted as c = {c 1 , c 2 , ... , c n } and a = { a 1 , a 2 , ... , a m } , respectively .
Each word is represented by the pre-trained GloVe embedding ( Pennington et al. , 2014 ) .
Furthermore , for the words in context , we also append the answer tagging embeddings as described in Zhao et al . ( 2018 ) .
The context and answer embeddings are fed into two bidirectional LSTM - RNNs separately to obtain their initial contextual representations C 0 ? R d?n and A 0 ? R d?m , in which d is the hidden state dimension in LSTM .
Answer - aware Context Encoder Inspired by the co-attention reasoning mechanism in previous machine reading comprehension works ( Xiong et al. , 2016 ) , we compute the answeraware context representation via the following steps : S = C T 0 A 0 ? R n?m ( 1 ) S = softmax ( S ) ? R n?m ( 2 ) S = softmax ( S T ) ? R m?n ( 3 ) A 0 = C 0 ? S ? R d?m ( 4 ) C1 = [ A 0 ; A 0 ] ? S ? R 2d?n ( 5 ) C 1 = BiLSTM ( [ C1 ; C 0 ] ) ? R d?n ( 6 ) Firstly , we compute an alignment matrix S ( Eq.1 ) , and normalize it column -wise and rowwise to get two attention matrices S ( Eq.2 ) and S ( Eq.3 ) .
S represents the relevance of each answer token over the context , and S represents the relevance of each context token over the answer .
The new answer representation A 0 w.r.t. the context is obtained by Eq.4 .
Next , the answer dependent context representation is calculated by concatenating old and new answer representations and times the attention weight matrix S ( Eq.5 ) .
Finally , to deeply incorporate the interaction between answer and context , we feed the answer dependent representation C1 combined with original C 0 into a bi-directional LSTM and obtain the answer - aware context encoding C 1 ( Eq.6 ) .
GCN - based Entity - aware Answer Encoder
As shown in Figure 2 , in order to obtain the multihop answer representation , we first compute the entity encoding from the answer - aware context encoding C 1 , then we apply GCN to propagate multihop information on the answer - aware sub-graph .
Finally we obtain the updated answer encoding A 1 via bi-attention mechanism .
Entity Graph Construction
The entity graph is constructed with the name entities in context as nodes , where we use BERT - based name entity recognition model to recognize name entities from the context .
The edges are created for the entity pairs if they are in the same sentence , or appear in the same paragraphs .
We also connect the entities from each paragraph title to entities within the same paragraph .
Entity Encoding With the answer- aware context encoding C 1 obtained from Answer - aware Context Encoder , we use a mapping matrix M to calculate the entity encoding .
M is a binary matrix where M i , j = 1 if the i-th token in the context is within the span of the j-th entity .
Each entity 's encoding will be calculated via a mean-max pooling applied over it 's corresponding context token encoding span .
E 0 = {e 1 , e 2 , ... , e g } ?
R 2d?g , where g is the number of entities , and 2d is the dimension since we directly concatenate the meanpooling and max-pooling encoding .
Answer- aware GCN
First we calculate an answer - aware sub-graph , where irrelevant entities are masked out , only those entity nodes related to answer are allowed to disseminate information .
Similar to Xiao et al. ( 2019 ) , a soft mask M = [ m 1 , m 2 , ... , m g ] is calculated via Eq. 7 , where each m i indicate the relatedness of the entity i to the answer , and then apply M on the original graph entities to obtain answer - aware dynamic sub entities graph E sub via Eq. 8 . M = ?( a T 0 ? V ? E 0 ) ? R 1 ?g ( 7 ) E sub = M ? E 0 ( 8 ) where V is a linear projection matrix and a 0 is the mean pooling over answer encoding A 0 , and ? is sigmoid function .
Then we calculate the answer- aware sub-graph 's attention matrix as described in Veli?kovi ?
et al. ( 2017 ) A G = {? i , j } ?
R g?g , where ?
i , j represents the information that will be assigned from entity i to it 's neighbor j , and obtain the one- layer information propagation over the sub-graph via : E 1 = ReLU ( A G ? E sub ) ( 9 ) The computation from Eq. 9 can be repeated for multiple times to obtain multi-hop entity representation E M . Multi-hop Answer Encoding we use biattention mechanism ( Seo et al. , 2016 ) regarding entities on the sub-graph as memories to update our multi-hop answer encoding A 1 via : A 1 = BiAttention ( A 0 , E M ) ( 10 )
Encoder Reasoning Gate
We apply a gated feature fusion module on the answer - aware context representations C 1 and C 2 from previous context encoder hops , to keep and forget information to form the final context representation C f inal via : C f inal = g t C 1 +( 1? g t ) C 2 ( 11 ) g t = ?( w T 2 C 2 +w T 1 C 1 +w T 0 C 0 +b ) ( 12 ) 2 .
Maxout Pointer Decoder Uni-directional LSTM model is utilized as the decoder of our model .
Moreover , we introduce the Maxout Pointer proposed by Zhao et al . ( 2018 ) into the decoder for sake of reducing the repetitions in the generation .
Pointer Generator enables the decoder to generate the next output token by either computing from the generative probabilistic distribution over the vocabulary or copying from the input sequence .
To compute the copy score , the attention over the input sequence which has a vocabulary of V from the current decoder hidden state is leveraged .
For the Maxout Pointer Generator , instead of leveraging all the attention score over the input tokens , only the maximal is taken into consideration to avoid the repetitions caused by the input tokens ( as it 's shown in Eq. 13 , where a t , k annotates the decoder- encoder attention score ) .
sc copy = ? ? ? max k, where x k =yt a t , k , y t ?
V ?inf , otherwise ( 13 )
Breadth - First Search Loss
In addition to the cross-entropy loss , we also introduce Breadth - First Search ( BFS ) Loss ( Xiao et al. , 2019 ) which is a weakly supervised loss to further assist the training procedure .
Given the answer entities , we conduct the BFS over the adjacent matrices of the entity graph we build to obtain heuristic masks as a weak supervision signal .
The BFS loss is calculated via binary cross-entropy loss between the predicted soft masks M in GCN - based Entity - aware Answer Encoder ( Section 2.1.2 ) and the heuristic masks using Eq. 14 to encourage the model to learn the answer - aware dynamic entity graph better .
where ? here is a heuristic number and can be selected using cross-validation .
Loss = L CrossEntropy + ?L BF S ( 14 )
Experiment
Dataset
To demonstrate the performance of our model , we conduct the experiments using HotpotQA ( Yang et al. , 2018 ) dataset in an opposite manner .
In the QG task , paragraphs and the answers are considered as input , while the corresponding questions are the expected output .
HotpotQA is a multihop question answering dataset , which contains Wikipedia - based question - answer pairs , with each question requiring multi-hop reasoning across multiple paragraphs to infer the answer .
There are mainly two types of multi-hop reasoning in the HotpotQA dataset : bridge and comparison .
Focusing on the multi-hop ability of our model , we filter out all the yes / no data samples in the dataset and run our experiments using the remaining corresponding train and test set , which consists of 73 k questions in the training set and 8 k in the test set .
Baselines
Since multi-hop QG has been under explored so far , there are very few existing baselines for our comparison .
We choose the following two models because of their high relevance with our task and relatively superior performance : MP - GSN is the first QG model to demonstrate a large improvement with paragraph - level inputs for single - hop QG proposed by Zhao et al . ( 2018 ) .
While they conducted their experiments on SQuAD ( Rajpurkar et al. , 2016 ) , we use exactly the same experiment settings provided in their configuration file on HotpotQA dataset .
RefNet is the first work that has reported results on HotpotQA dataset for QG proposed by Nema et al . ( 2019 ) .
However , their inputs based on the gold supporting sentences , which contains the facts related to the multi-hop question , and no paragraphlevel results have been shown .
We experiment with the code they released on paragraphs - level , and test their model 's performance on both their validation set and test set of HotpotQA dataset .
We also fine-tuned large pre-trained language models UniLM ( Dong et al. , 2019 ) and BART ( Lewis et al. , 2019 ) on the multi-hop QG task as comparison benchmark , to further show the effectiveness of our method .
The details and the results will be covered in Appendix .
The mean values and the standard deviations of the first three evaluation scores , along with the percentage of questions assessed as multi-hop type are shown above .
Model
Implementation Details
Our word embeddings are initialized by glove .
840B.300d ( Pennington et al. , 2014 ) and we keep our vocab size as 45000 .
We use two -layer bi-directional LSTMs for encoder and two -layer uni-directional LSTMs for decoder , and the hidden size is 300 for all the models .
We use stochastic gradient descent ( SGD ) as the optimizer .
The initial learning rate is 0.1 , and it is reduced during the training stage using a cosine annealing scheduler ( Loshchilov and Hutter , 2016 ) .
The batch size is 12 and the beam size is 10 .
We set the dropout probability for LSTM to 0.2 and 0.3 for GCN .
The maximum number of epochs is set to 20 .
We set the maximum number of entities in each context to 80 , and we use a two -layer GCN in our GCN - based answer encoder module .
After training the model for 10 epochs , we further fine - tune the MulQG model with the help of BFS loss , where the ? in Eq.14 is set to 0.5 .
Automatic Evaluation
Metrics
We use the metrics in previous work on single - hop QG to evaluate the generation performance of our model , with n-gram similarity metrics BLEU 1 ( Papineni et al. , 2002 ) , ROUGE -L ( LIN , 2004 ) , and METEOR using the package released in Lavie and Denkowski ( 2009 ) .
We also quantify the QBLEU4 ( Nema and Khapra , 2018a ) and answerability score of our models , which was shown to correlate significantly better with human judgements ( Nema and Khapra , 2018 b ) .
Results and Analysis Table 2 shows the performance of various models on the HotpotQA test set .
We report the both results of the experiments on our proposed model before and after fine-tuning with auxiliary BFS loss .
As it 's shown in the table , our MulQG model perform much better than the two baselines methods , with 1 https://github.com/Maluuba/nlg-eval regard to all those measuring metrics , which indicates that the multi-hop procedure can significantly boost the quality of the encoding representations and thus improve the multi-hop question generation performance .
Also the BFS loss can further improve the system performance by encouraging learning the answer - aware dynamic entity graph better , which is a key and bottleneck module in the MulQG model .
Ablation Study
To further evaluate and investigate the performance of different components in our model , we perform the ablation study .
As we can see from Table 3 , both the GCN - based entity - aware answer encoder module and Gated Context Reasoning module are important to the model .
Each of them provides a relative contribution of 2 % - 3 % for overall performance improvement .
w/o GEAEnc : Without GCN - based Entityaware Answer Encoder , answer-related multi-hop evidence information cannot be identified .
Without multi-hop answer encoding being updated , next step 's answer - aware context encoding will be affected and thus the performance will drop a lot .
w/o GEAEnc + ACEnc : The performance continues to decrease but not that much .
This matches with our expectation , since without an informative input A 1 containing multi-hop information from the GCN - based Entity - aware Answer Encoder , the Answer- aware Context Encoder ? cannot generate an informative C 2 .
Thus remove it wo n't hurt the performance that much .
w/o ERG : When we remove the Encoder Reasoning Gate , the performance drops by around 3 % in BLEU -1 .
This also matches our intuition since without effective feature reasoning and fusion , all the previous encoders cannot generate effective representations .
Thus the generation performance will be affected .
w/o GEAEnc + ACEnc + ERG : Without the three modules , the performance directly drops to Example I Paragraph A : :::::::::::::::::::

Human : name the actor who has acted in the film arrival and who has been nominated for the academy award for best supporting actor for the film " the town " ? single - hop QG system level , which proves the contributions of the whole proposed model .
MulQG ( 1- layer GCN ) :
When apply 1 - layer GCN and only allow information propagation being limited to each node 's neighbor , the answer-related evidences might not be able to be fully obtained , thus the performance are not as good as our 2 - layer GCN - based model .
Human Evaluation Human evaluation is conducted to further analyze the performance of our model ( Table 4 ) .
We compare the generated questions from MP - GSN model , our model and gold ones on four metrics :
Fluency , Completeness , Answerability and whether the generated questions are multi-hop question or not .
Fluency emphasizes the grammar correctness of the question , while Completeness only focuses on the sentence completeness .
Answerability mainly indicates the relationship between the answers and the generated questions .
For the first three index , the score for each data sample could be chosen from { 1,2,3 } in comparison with the other samples generated from the other two models with the same input , where a higher score indicates a better performance on that matrix , For the multi-hop evaluation , we only carry out binary discrimination .
We randomly sample 100 data samples from the test set .
Ten annotators are asked in total to evaluate them on the aforementioned four metrics .
Each sample is evaluated by three different annotators .
To present a more convincing analysis , we conduct the t-test on the human evaluation results .
All the reported results between our proposed model and the baseline are statistically significant with a p-value < 0.05 .
We also calculate the inter-annotator agreement using Fleiss ' Kappa ( Fleiss , 1971 ) measure and achieve high agreement scores on the proposed model .
We observe that our MulQG model largely outperforms the MP - GSN model in terms of Fluency , Answerability and Completeness with more stable quality .
Moreover , our model tends to generate more complete question and achieve comparable completeness score with the human annotations .
For the multi-hop evaluation , we outperform the strongest baseline by 20.8 % on the multi-hop evaluation .
Case Study
We present a case study comparing between the strong baseline MP - GSN model , our model and the human annotations .
Three cases are presented in Figure 3 .
In the first two examples , it 's clearly shown in the examples that the baseline model tends to copy a contiguous and long span of context as the generation , while our proposed model performs better in this aspect .
we observe that since the supporting fact information is not leveraged in our method , the generated questions from our model may show a different reasoning path with that for the gold question .
There could be multiple ways to construct a multi-hop question given the same input .
So the generations may be much different from the gold label , although they are still correct questions , which could be indicated from the first two examples .
This phenomenon causes a lower score in automatic matrices , such as BLEU and METEOR , but we note that the generated questions still follow the multi-hop scheme and can be answered with the given answers .
In Example III , we show the data sample in an easier mode .
In this case , while the answer entity is in one paragraph , a similar entity ( annotated with orange color ) also appears in another paragraph , which gives a strong clue of the reasoning path and makes it easier for the model to attend to both paragraphs .
The generations from our model and the human annotation show almost the same reasoning path .
However , we observe that the question generated by MP - GSN model still tends to attend to the entities that are closer to the answer entities .
Moreover , for the human annotation in Example I and Example III , the gold questions have a problem with fluency , which is harmful for the QG models , but interestingly , even with training using these labels , our model is still capable of generating rela-tively fluent outputs .
Related Work Question Generation Early single- hop QG use rule-based methods to transform sentences to questions ( Labutov et al. , 2015 ; Lindberg et al. , 2013 ) .
Recently neural network based approaches adopt the sequence- to-sequence ( Seq2Seq ) based framework , with different types of encoders and decoders have been designed Nema et al. , 2019 ; Zhao et al. , 2018 ) .
Zhao et al. ( 2018 ) proposes to incorporate paragraph level content by using Gated Self Attention and Maxout pointer networks , while Nema et al . ( 2019 ) proposes a model which contains two decoders where the second decoder refines the question generated by the first decoder using reinforcement learning .
There are different ways to attend answer information to the context encoding stage .
and directly concatenate answer tagging with the context embedding , while Nema et al . ( 2019 ) also applies bi-attention mechanism proposed by Seo et al . ( 2016 ) for QA to do answer - aware context representation .
Chen et al. ( 2019 ) is the most recent work which proposes a reinforcement learning based graph- to-sequence ( Graph2Seq ) model which use a bidirectional graph encoder on a syntax - based graph for QG , while they still focus on the single - hop QG .
Multi-hop QA Popular Graph Nueral Network ( GNN ) frameworks , such as graph convolutional networks ( Kipf and Welling , 2016 ) , graph attention network ( Veli?kovi ?
et al. , 2017 ) , and graph recurrent network ( Song et al. , 2018 ) have been explored and showed promising results on multi-hop QA task that requiring reasoning .
Xiao et al. ( 2019 ) proposes a dynamic fused graph network to work on multi-hop QA on the HotpotQA dataset .
De Cao et al . ( 2018 ) proposes an entity - GCN method to reason over across multiple documents for multi-hop QA on the WIKIHOP dataset ( Welbl et al. , 2018 ) .
Conclusion Multi-hop QG task is more challenging and worthy of exploration compared to conventional singlehop QG .
To address the additional challenges in multi-hop QG , we propose MulQG , which does multi-hop context encoding with Graph Convolutional Network and encoding fusion via a Gated Reasoning module .
To the best of our knowledge , we are the first to tackle the challenge of multi-hop reasoning over paragraphs without any sentencelevel information .
The model performance on Hot-potQA dataset demonstrates its effectiveness on aggregating scattered pieces of evidence across the paragraphs and fusing information effectively to generate multi-hop questions .
The strong reasoning ability of the Multi-hop Encoder in the MulQA model can potentially be leveraged in complex generation tasks for the future work .
