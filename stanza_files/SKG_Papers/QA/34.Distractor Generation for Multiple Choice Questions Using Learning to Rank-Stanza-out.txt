Distractor Generation for Multiple Choice Questions Using Learning to Rank
abstract
We investigate how machine learning models , specifically ranking models , can be used to select useful distractors for multiple choice questions .
Our proposed models can learn to select distractors that resemble those in actual exam questions , which is different from most existing unsupervised ontology - based and similarity - based methods .
We empirically study feature - based and neural net ( NN ) based ranking models with experiments on the recently released SciQ dataset and our MCQL dataset .
Experimental results show that feature - based ensemble learning methods ( random forest and LambdaMART ) outperform both the NN - based method and unsupervised baselines .
These two datasets can also be used as benchmarks for distractor generation .
Introduction Multiple choice questions ( MCQs ) are widely used as an assessment of students ' knowledge and skills .
A MCQ consists of three elements : ( i ) stem , the question sentence ; ( ii ) key , the correct answer ; ( iii ) distractors , alternative answers used to distract students from the correct answer .
Among all methods for creating good MCQs , finding reasonable distractors is crucial and usually the most time - consuming .
We here investigate automatic distractor generation ( DG ) , i.e. , generating distractors given the stem and the key to the question .
We focus on the case where distractors are not limited to single words and can be phrases and sentences .
Rather than generate trivial wrong answers , the goal of DG is to generate plausible false answers - good distractors .
Specifically , a " good " distractor should be at least semantically related to the key ( Goodrich , 1977 ) , grammatically correct given the stem , and consistent with the semantic context of the stem .
Taking these cri-terion into consideration , most existing methods for DG are based on various similarity measures .
These include WordNet - based metrics ( Mitkov and Ha , 2003 ) , embedding - based similarities ( Guo et al. , 2016 ; Kumar et al. , 2015 ; Jiang and Lee , 2017 ) , n-gram co-occurrence likelihood ( Hill and Simha , 2016 ) , phonetic and morphological similarities ( Pino and Eskenazi , 2009 ) , structural similarities in an ontology ( Stasaski and Hearst , 2017 ) , a thesaurus ( Sumita et al. , 2005 ) , context similarity ( Pino et al. , 2008 ) , context-sensitive inference ( Zesch and Melamud , 2014 ) , and syntactic similarity ( Chen et al. , 2006 ) .
Then distractors are selected from a candidate distractor set based on a weighted combination of similarities , where the weights are determined by heuristics .
In contrast to the above-mentioned similaritybased methods , we apply learning - based ranking models to select distractors that resemble those in actual exam MCQs .
Specifically , we propose two types of models for DG : feature - based and NNbased models .
Our models are able to take existing heuristics as features and learn from these questions a function beyond a simple linear combination .
Learning to generate distractors has been previously explored in a few studies .
Given a blanked question , Sakaguchi et al . ( 2013 ) use a discriminative model to predict distractors and Liang et al . ( 2017 ) apply generative adversarial nets .
They view DG as a multi-class classification problem and use answers as output labels while we use them as input .
Other related work ( Welbl et al. , 2017 ) uses a random forest .
However , with the reported binary classification metrics , the quality of the top generated distractors is not quantitatively evaluated .
Here we conduct a more comprehensive study on various learning models and devise ranking evaluation metrics for DG .
Machine learning of a robust model usually requires large-scale training data .
However , to the best of our knowledge , there is no benchmark dataset for DG , which makes it difficult to directly compare methods .
Prior methods were evaluated on different question sets collected from textbooks ( Agarwal and Mannem , 2011 ) , Wikipedia ( Liang et al. , 2017 ) , ESL corpuses ( Sakaguchi et al. , 2013 ) , etc .
We propose to evaluate DG methods with two datasets : the recently released SciQ dataset ( Welbl et al. , 2017 ) ( 13.7 K MCQs ) and the MCQL dataset ( 7.1 K MCQs ) that we made .
These two datasets can be used as benchmarks for training and testing DG models .
Our experimental results show that feature - based ensemble learning methods ( random forest and LambdaMART ) outperform both the NN - based method and unsupervised baselines for DG .
Learning to Rank for Distractor Generation
We solve DG as the following ranking problem : Problem .
Given a candidate distractor set D and a MCQ dataset M = {( q i , a i , {d i1 , ... , d ik } ) }
N i=1 , where q i is the question stem , a i is the key , D i = {d i1 ...d ik } ?
D are the distractors associated with q i and a i , find a point- wise ranking function r : ( q i , a i , d ) ? [ 0 , 1 ] for d ?
D , such that distractors in D i are ranked higher than those in D ? D i .
This problem formulation is similar to " learning to rank " ( Liu et al. , 2009 ) in information retrieval .
To learn the ranking function , we investigate two types of models : feature - based models and NNbased models .
Feature - based Models
Feature Description Given a tuple ( q , a , d ) , a feature - based model first transforms it to a feature vector ?( q , a , d ) ?
R d with the function ?.
We design the following features for DG , resulting in a 26 - dimension feature vector : ? Emb Sim .
Embedding similarity between q and d and the similarity between a and d .
We use the average GloVe embedding ( Pennington et al. , 2014 ) as the sentence embedding .
Embeddings have been shown to be effective for finding semantically similar distractors ( Kumar et al. , 2015 ; Guo et al. , 2016 ) . ? POS Sim .
Jaccard similarity between a and d's POS tags .
The intuition is that ditractors might also be noun phrases if the key is a noun phrase .
? ED .
Edit distance between a and d .
This measures the spelling similarity and is useful for cases such as selecting " RNA " as a distractor for " DNA " .
?
Token Sim .
Jaccard similarities between q and d's tokens , a and d's tokens , and q and a's tokens .
This feature is motivated by the observation that distractors might share tokens with the key .
? Length .
a and d's character and token lengths and the difference of lengths .
This feature is designed to explore whether distractors and the key are similar in terms of lengths .
? Suffix .
The absolute and relative length of a and d's longest common suffix .
The key and distractors often have common suffixes .
For example , " maltose " , " lactose " , and " suctose " could be good distractors for " fructose " .
? Freq .
Average word frequency in a and d .
Word frequency has been used as a proxy for words ' difficulty levels ( Coniam , 1997 ) .
This feature is designed to select distractors with a similar difficulty level as the key .
?
Single .
Singular / plural consistency of a and d .
This checks the consistency of singular vs. plural usage , which will select grammatically correct distractors given the stem .
?
Num .
Whether numbers appear in a and d .
This feature will cover cases where distractors and keys contain numbers , such as " 90 degree " , " one year " , " 2018 " , etc. ? Wiki Sim .
If a and d are Wikipedia entities , we calculate their Wiki embedding similarity .
The embedding is trained using word2vec ( Mikolov et al. , 2013 ) on Wikipedia data with each Wiki entity treated as an individual token .
This feature is a complement to Emb Sim where sentence embedding is a simple average of word embeddings .
Classifiers
We study the following three feature - based classifiers : ( i ) Logistic Regression : an efficient generalized linear classification model ; ( ii ) Random Forest ( Breiman , 2001 )
Assume that the discriminator is based on an arbitrary scoring function f ? ( d , q , a ) ?
R parameterized by ? , then the objective for D is to maximize the following log-likelihood : max ? E d?Ptrue ( d | q , a ) [ log ( ? ( f ? ( d , q , a ) ) ) ] + E d?P ? ( d|q , a ) [ log ( 1 ? ?( f ? ( d , q , a ) ) ) ] ( 1 ) where ? is the sigmoid function .
For the generator G , we choose another scoring function f ? ( d , q , a ) ?
R parameterized by ? , evaluate it on every possible distractor d i given a ( q , a ) pair , and sample generated distractors based on the discrete probability after applying softmax : p ? ( d i |q , a ) = exp (?
? f ? ( d i , q , a ) ) j exp (?
? f ? ( d j , q , a ) ) ( 2 ) where ? is a temperature hyper-parameter .
In practice , since the total size of distractors is large , it is very time - consuming to evaluate on every possible d i .
Following the common practice as in ( Wang et al. , 2017 ; Cai and Wang , 2018 ) , we uniformly sample K candidate distractors for each ( q , a ) pair and evaluate f ? on each d i , ?i ? [ 1 , K ] .
The objective for G is to " fool " D so that D misclassifies distractors generated by G as positive : min ? E d?P ? ( d|q , a ) [ log ( 1 ? ?( f ? ( d , q , a ) ) ) ]
( 3 )
The training procedure follows a two -player minimax game , where D and G are alternatively optimized towards their own objective .
The scoring function f ? and f ? can take arbitrary forms .
IRGAN utilizes a convolutional neu - ral network based model to obtain sentence embeddings and then calculates the cosine similarities .
However , such a method ignores the wordlevel interactions , which is important for the DG task .
For example , if the stem asks " which physical unit " , good distractors should be units .
Therefore , we adopt the Decomposable Attention model ( DecompAtt ) ( Parikh et al. , 2016 ) proposed for Natural Language Inference to measure the similarities between q and d .
We also consider the similarities between a and d .
Since they are usually short sequences , we simply use the cosine similarity between summed word embeddings .
As such , the scoring function is defined as a linear combination of DecompAtt ( d , q ) and Cosine ( d , a ) .
Cascaded Learning Framework
To make the ranking process more efficient and effective , we propose a cascaded learning framework , a multistage ensemble learning framework that has been widely used for computer vision ( Viola and Jones , 2001 For SciQ , we follow the original train / valid / test splits .
For MCQL , we randomly divide the dataset into train / valid / test with an approximate ratio of 10:1:1 .
We convert the dataset to lowercase , filter out the distractors such as " all of them " , " none of them " , " both A and B " , and keep questions with at least one distractor .
We use all the keys and distractors in the dataset as candidate distractor set D. Table 1 summarizes the statistics of the two datasets after preprocessing .
| D| is the number of candidate distractors .
# MCQs is the total number of MCQs .
# Train / Valid / Test is the number of questions in each split of the dataset .
Avg. # Dis is the average number of distractors per question .
Experiment Settings
We use Logistic Regression ( LR ) as the first stage ranker .
As for the second stage , we compare LR , Random Forest ( RF ) , LambdaMART ( LM ) , and the proposed NN - based model ( NN ) .
Specifically , we set C to 1 for LR , use 500 trees for RF , and 500 rounds of boosting for LM .
For first stage training , the number of negative samples is set to be equal to the number of distractors , which is 3 for most questions .
And we sample 100 negative samples for second stage training .
More details can be found in the supplementary material .
In addition , we also study the following unsupervised baselines that measure similarities between the key and distractors : ( i ) pointwise mutual information ( PMI ) based on co-occurrences ; ( ii ) edit distance ( ED ) , which measures the spelling similarity ; and ( iii ) GloVe embedding similarity ( Emb Sim ) .
For evaluation , we report top recall ( R@10 ) , precision ( P@1 , P@3 ) , mean average precision ( MAP@10 ) , normalized discounted cumulative gain ( NDCG@10 ) , and mean reciprocal rank ( MRR ) .
Experimental Results
First Stage Ranker
The main goal of the first stage ranker is to reduce the candidate size for the later stage while achieving a relatively high recall .
Figure 1 shows the Recall@K for the first stage ranker on the two datasets .
Validation set is used for choosing top K predictions for later stage training .
We empirically set K to 2000 for SciQ and 2500 for MCQL to get a recall of about 90 % .
Distractor Ranking Results
A Training and Implementation Details Feature- based Models .
We use the implementations of scikit-learn ( Pedregosa et al. , 2011 ) for logistic regression and random forest experiments .
For LambdaMART experiments , we use the XG - Boost library ( Chen and Guestrin , 2016 ) .
For both SCIQ and MCQL datasets we train with 500 rounds of boosting , step size shrinkage of 0.1 , maximum depth of 30 , minimum child weight of 0.1 and minimum loss reduction of 1.0 for partition .
For calculating Wiki Sim features , we use a Wikipedia dump of Oct. 2016 .
Part of speech tags are calculated with NLTK ( Bird and Loper , 2004 ) .
The logistic regression used for the first stage ranker is based on features including : Emb Sim , POS Sim , ED , Token Sim , Length , Suffix , and Freq .
Models for the second stage ranker is based on all features described in Sec. 2.1.1 .
NN - based Models .
Our NN - based models are implemented with TensorFlow ( Abadi et al. , 2016 ) .
When training the generator , we first uniformly select K = 512 candidates and then sample 16 distractors according to Equation 2 .
The temperature ? is set to 5 .
Our scoring functions are based on Decomposable Attention Model ( Parikh et al. , 2016 ) .
The word embeddings are initialized using the pre-trained GloVe ( Pennington et al. , 2014 ) ( 840B tokens ) , and the embedding size is 300 .
Our model is optimized using Adam algorithm ( Kingma and Ba , 2015 ) with a learning rate of 1e - 4 and a weight decay of 1e - 6 .
Since the sampling process in G is not differentiable , the gradient - decent - based optimization in the original GAN paper ( Goodfellow et al. , 2014 ) is not directly applicable .
To tackle this problem , we use policy gradient based reinforcement learning as in IRGAN .
: an effective ensemble classification model ; ( iii ) LambdaMART ( Burges , 2010 ) : a gradient boosted tree based learning - torank model .
To train these models , following previous notations , we use D i as positive examples and sample from D ? D i to get negative examples .
2.2 NN - based Models Based on the recently proposed method IR - GAN ( Wang et al. , 2017 ) , we propose an adver - sarial training framework for DG .
Our framework consists of two components : a generator G and a discriminator D. G is a generative model that aims to capture the conditional probability of generat - ing distractors given stems and answers P ( d|q , a ) .
D is a discriminative model that estimates the probability that a distractor sample comes from the real training data rather than G .

Table 2 : 2 Ranking results ( % ) for DG .
the following : ( i ) The proposed ranking mod- els perform better than unsupervised similarity - based methods ( PMI , ED , and Emb Sim ) most of the time , which is expected since similarity - based heuristics are used as features .
( ii ) Ensem - ble models - RF and LM - have comparable perfor - mance and are significantly better than other meth - ods .
These ensemble methods are more suitable for capturing the nonlinear relation between the proposed feature set and distractors .
( iii ) NN per- forms worse than feature - based models .
The main reason is that NN is solely based on word embed - dings .
Although embedding similarity is the most important feature , information provided by other top features such as ED , Suffix , Freq is missing in NN .
Given the limited training examples ( 11.6 K for SciQ and 6 K for MCQL ) , it is difficult to learn a robust end-to- end NN - based model .
Table 3 : 3 Top 10 important features .
Feature Analysis
We conduct a feature analysis to have more insights on the proposed feature set .
Feature importance is calculated by " mean decrease impurity " using RF .
It is defined as the total decrease in node impurity , weighted by the probability of reaching that node , averaged over all trees of the ensemble .
Table3lists the top 10 important features for SciQ and MCQL datasets .
We find that : ( i ) the embedding similarity between a and d is the most important feature , which shows embeddings are effective at capturing semantic relations between a and d .
( ii ) String similarities such as Token Sim , ED , and Suffix are more important in MCQL than those in SciQ .
This is consistent with the observation that ED has relatively good performance as seen in Table2 b .
( iii )
The set of top 10 features is the same for SciQ and MCQL , regardless of order .
Effects of Cascaded Learning Since we choose the top 2000 for SciQ and 2500 for MCQL from first stage , the ranking candidate size is reduced by 91 % for SciQ and 85 % for MCQL , which makes the second stage learning more efficient .
To study whether cascaded learning is effective , we exper - iment with RF and LM without 2 - stage learning , as shown as the bottom two rows in Table 2 .
Here we sample 100 negative samples for training mod- els in order to make a fair comparison with other methods using 2 - stage learning .
We can see that the performance is better when cascaded learning is applied .
4 Conclusion
We investigated DG as a ranking problem and applied feature - based and NN - based supervised ranking models to the task .
Experiments with the SciQ and the MCQL datasets empirically show that ensemble learning models ( random forest and LambdaMART ) outperform both the NN - based
