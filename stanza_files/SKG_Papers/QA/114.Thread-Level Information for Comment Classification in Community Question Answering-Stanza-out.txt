Thread - Level Information for Comment Classification in Community Question Answering
abstract
Community Question Answering ( cQA ) is a new application of QA in social contexts ( e.g. , fora ) .
It presents new interesting challenges and research directions , e.g. , exploiting the dependencies between the different comments of a thread to select the best answer for a given question .
In this paper , we explored two ways of modeling such dependencies : ( i ) by designing specific features looking globally at the thread ; and ( ii ) by applying structure prediction models .
We trained and evaluated our models on data from SemEval - 2015 Task 3 on Answer Selection in cQA .
Our experiments show that : ( i ) the thread - level features consistently improve the performance for a variety of machine learning models , yielding state - of - the - art results ; and ( ii ) sequential dependencies between the answer labels captured by structured prediction models are not enough to improve the results , indicating that more information is needed in the joint model .
Introduction Community Question Answering ( cQA ) is an evolution of a typical QA setting put in a Web forum context , where user interaction is enabled , without much restrictions on who can post and who can answer a question .
This is a powerful mechanism , which allows users to freely ask questions and expect some good , honest answers .
Unfortunately , a user has to go through all possible answers and to make sense of them .
It is often the case that many answers are only loosely related to the actual question , and some even change the topic .
This is especially common for long threads where , as the thread progresses , users start talking to each other , instead of trying to answer the initial question .
This is a real problem , as a question can have hundreds of answers , the vast majority of which would not satisfy the users ' information needs .
Thus , finding the desired information in a long list of answers might be very time - consuming .
The problem of selecting the relevant text passages ( i.e. , those containing good answers ) has been tackled in QA research , either for non-factoid QA or for passage reranking .
Usually , automatic classifiers are applied to the answer passages retrieved by a search engine to derive a relative order ; see ( Radlinski and Joachims , 2005 ; Jeon et al. , 2005 ; Shen and Lapata , 2007 ; Moschitti et al. , 2007 ; Surdeanu et al. , 2008 ; Heilman and Smith , 2010 ; Wang and Manning , 2010 ; Severyn and Moschitti , 2012 ; Yao et al. , 2013 ; for detail .
To the best of our knowledge , there is no QA work that effectively identifies good answers based on the selection of the other answers retrieved for a question .
This is mainly due to the loose dependencies between the different answer passages in standard QA .
In contrast , we postulate that in a cQA setting , the answers from different users in a common thread are strongly interconnected and , thus , a joint answer selection model should be adopted to achieve higher accuracy .
To test our hypothesis about the usefulness of thread - level information , we used a publicly available dataset , recently developed for the SemEval - 2015 Task 3 . Subtask
A in that challenge asks to identify the posts in the answer thread that answer the question well vs .
those that can be potentially useful to the user vs. those that are just bad or useless .
We model the thread - level dependencies in two different ways : ( i ) by designing specific features that are able to capture the dependencies between the answers in the same thread ; and ( ii ) by exploiting the sequential organization of the output labels for the complete thread .
For the latter , we used the usual extensions of Logistic Regression and SVM to linear-chain models such as CRF and SVM hmm .
The results clearly show that the thread - level features are important , providing consistent improvement for all our learning models .
In contrast , the linear-chain models fail to exploit the sequential dependencies between nearby answer labels to improve the results significantly : although the labels from the neighboring answers can affect the label of the current answer , this dependency is too loose to have impact on the selection accuracy .
In other words , labels should be used together with answers ' content to account for stronger and more effective dependencies .
The Task
We use the CQA - QL corpus , which was used for Subtask A of SemEval - 2015 Task 3 on Answer Selection in cQA .
The corpus contains data from the Qatar Living forum , 1 and is publicly available on the task 's website .
2
The dataset consists of questions and a list of the answers for each question , i.e. , the question - answer thread .
Each question , and also each answer , consists of a short title and a more detailed description .
Moreover , there is some meta information associated with both , e.g. , ID of the user asking / answering the question , timestamp , question category , etc .
The task asks to determine for each answer in the thread whether it is good , bad , or potentially useful .
A simplified example is shown in Figure 1 , 3 where answers 2 and 4 are good , answer 1 is potentially useful , and answer 3 is bad .
Below , we start with the original definition of Subtask A , as described above .
Then , we switch to a binary classification setting ( i.e. , identifying good vs. bad answers ) , which is much closer to a real cQA application ( see Section 4.3 ) .
3 Basic and Thread - Level Features Subsection 3.1 summarizes the basic features we used to implement the baseline systems .
More importantly , Section 3.2 describes the set of threadlevel features we designed in order to test our working hypothesis .
Below we use the following notation : q is a question posted by user u q , c is a comment , and C is the comment thread .
Baseline Features
We measure lexical and syntactic similarity between q and c .
We compute the similarity between word n-grams ( n = [ 1 , . . . , 4 ] ) , after stopword removal , using greedy string tiling ( Wise , 1996 ) , longest common subsequences ( Allison and Dix , 1986 ) , Jaccard coefficient ( Jaccard , 1901 ) , word containment ( Lyon et al. , 2001 ) , and cosine similarity .
We also apply partial tree kernels ( Moschitti , 2006 ) on shallow syntactic trees .
We designed a set of heuristic features that might suggest whether c is good or not .
Forty - four Boolean features express whether c ( i ) includes URLs or emails ( 2 feats . ) ; ( ii ) contains the word " yes " , " sure " , " no " , " can " , " neither " , " okay " , and " sorry " , as well as symbols ' ? ' and ' @ ' ( 9 feats . ) ; ( iii ) starts with " yes " ( 1 feat . ) ; ( iv ) includes a sequence of three or more repeated characters or a word longer than fifteen characters ( 2 feats . ) ; ( v ) belongs to one of the categories of the forum ( Socialising , Life in Qatar , etc. ) ( 26 feats . ) ; and ( vi ) has been posted by the same u q , such a comment can include a question ( i.e. , contain a question mark ) , and acknowledgement ( e.g. , contain thank * , acknowl* ) , or none of them ( 4 feats . ) .
An extra feature captures the length of c ( as longergood - comments usually contain detailed information to answer a question ) .
Thread - Level Global Features
Comments are organized sequentially according to the time line of the comment thread .
4
The assumption is that an acknowledgment or further questions by u q in the thread could signal a good answer .
More specifically , they test if among the comments following c there is one by u q ( i ) containing an acknowledgment , ( ii ) not containing an acknowledgment , ( iii ) containing a question , and , ( iv ) if among the comments preceding c there is one by u q containing a question .
The value of these four features - a propagation of the information captured by some of the heuristics described in Section 3.1 - depends on the distance k , in terms of the number of comments , between c and the closest comment by u q : f ( c ) = max ( 0 , 1.1 ? ( k ? 0.1 ) ) 0 if no comments by u q exist , ( 1 ) that is , the closer the comment to c q , the higher the value assigned to this feature .
We try to model potential dialogues , which at the end represent bad comments , by identifying interlacing comments between two users .
Our dialogue features are identifying conversation chains : u i ? . . . ? u j ? . . . ? u i ? . . . ? [ u j ] .
Comments by other users can appear in between the nodes of this " pseudo-conversation " chain .
We consider three features : whether a comment is at the beginning , in the middle , or at the end of such a chain .
Three more features exist in those cases in which u q is one of the participants of these pseudo-conversations .
Another Boolean feature for c u i is set to true if u i wrote more than one comment in the current thread .
Three more features identify the first , the middle and the last comments by u i .
One extra feature counts the total number of comments written by u i in the thread up to that moment .
Moreover , we empirically observed that the likelihood of some comment being good decreases with its position in the thread .
Therefore , we also included another real- valued feature : max ( 20 , i ) / 20 , where i represents the position of the comment in the thread .
Finally , we perform a pseudo-ranking of the comments .
The relevance of c is computed as its similarity to q ( using word n-grams ) , normalized by the maximum similarity among all the comments in the thread .
The resulting relative scores are mapped into three binary features depending on the range they fall at : [ 0 , 0.2 ] , ( 0.2 , 0.8 ) , or [ 0.8 , 1 ] ( intervals resemble the three - class setting and were empirically set on the training data ) .
Experiments
Below we first describe the data we used , then we introduce the experimental setup , and finally we present and discuss the results of our experiments .
Data
The original CQA - QL corpus consists of 3,229 questions : 2,600 for training , 300 for development , and 329 for testing .
The total number of comments is 20,162 , with an average of 6.24 comments per question .
The class labels for the comments are distributed as follows : 9,941 good ( 49.31 % ) , 2,013 potential ( 9.98 % ) , and 8,208 bad ( 40.71 % ) comments .
Since a typical answer selection setting only considers correct and incorrect answers , we also experiment with potential labelled as bad .
Experimental Setup
Our local classifiers are support vector machines ( SVM ) with C = 1 ( Joachims , 1999 ) , logistic regression with a Gaussian prior with variance 10 , and logistic ordinal regression ( McCullagh , 1980 ) .
In order to capture long- range sequential dependencies , we use a second-order SVM hmm ( Yu and Joachims , 2008 ) ( with C = 500 and epsilon = 0.01 ) and a second-order linear-chain CRF , which considers dependencies between three neighboring labels in a sequence ( Lafferty et al. , 2001 ; Cuong et al. , 2014 ) .
In CRF , we perform two kinds of inference to find the most probable labels for the comments in a sequence .
( i) We compute the maximum a posterior ( MAP ) or the ( jointly ) most probable sequence of labels using the Viterbi algorithm .
Specifically , it computes y * = argmax y 1:T P (y 1:T |x 1:T ) , where T is the number of comments in the thread .
( ii ) We use the forward - backward algorithm to find the labels by maximizing ( individual ) posterior marginals ( MPM ) .
More formally , we compute ? = argmax y1 P ( y 1 |x 1:T ) , ? ? ? , argmax yT P (y T |x 1:T ) .
While MAP yields a globally consistent sequence of labels , MPM can be more robust in many cases ; see ( Murphy , 2012 , p. 613 ) for details .
CRF also uses a Gaussian prior with variance 10 .

Experiment results
In order to compare the quality of our features to the existing state of the art , we performed a first experiment aligned to the multi-class setting of the SemEval 2015 Task 3 competition .
Table 1 shows our results on the official test dataset .
As in the competition , the results are macroaveraged at class level .
The results of the top 3 systems are reported for comparison : JAIST ( Tran et al. , 2015 ) , HITSZ ( Hou et al. , 2015 ) and QCRI ( Nicosia et al. , 2015 ) , where the latter refers to our old system that we used for the competition .
The two main observations are ( i ) using threadlevel features helps significantly ; and ( ii ) the ordinal regression model , which captures the idea that potential lies between good and bad , achieves at least as good results as the top system at SemEval , namely JAIST .
For the remaining experiments , we reduce the multi-class problem to a binary one ( cf. Section 2 ) .
Table 2 shows the results obtained on the official test dataset .
Note that ordinal regression is not applicable in this binary setting .
The F 1 values for the baseline features suggest that using the labels in the thread sequence yields better performance with SVM hmm and CRF .
When thread - level features are used , the models using sequence labels do not outperform SVM and logistic regression anymore .
Regarding the two variations of CRF , the posterior marginals maximization is slightly better : maximizing on each comment pays more than on the entire thread .
Since the task consists in identifying good answers for a given question , further figures at the question level are necessary , i.e. , we compute the target performance measure for all comments of each question and then we average the results over all threads ( ta ) .
Table 2 shows such the result using two measures : F 1 and accuracy , i.e. , F 1 , ta and A ta , for which long threads have less impact on the final outcome .
The impact of the thread features is not-so- high in terms of these measures , sometimes even negatively affecting some of the models .
Cross validation .
In order to better understand the mixed results obtained on the single official test set , we performed 5 - fold cross validation over the entire dataset .
The results are shown in Table 3 .
When looking at the performance of the different models with the same set of features , no statistically significant differences are observed on F 1 or F 1 , ta ( t- test with confidence level 95 % ) .
The sequence of predicted labels in CRF or SVM hmm does not impact the final result .
In contrast , an important difference is observed when thread - level features come into play : the performance of all the models improves by approximately two F 1 points absolute , and statistically significant differences are observed for SVM and logistic regression ( ttest , 95 % ) .
Moreover , while on the test dataset the thread - level features do not always improve F 1 , ta and A ta , on the 5 - fold cross-validation using them is always beneficial : for F 1 , ta statistically significant difference is observed for SVM only ( t-test , 90 % ) .
Qualitative results .
In order to get an intuition about the effect of the thread - level features , we show two example comment threads in Figure 2 .
These comments are classified correctly when thread features are used in the classifier , and incorrectly when only basic features are used .
In the first case ( Q u 1 ) , the third comment is classified as good by models that only use basic features .
In contrast , thanks to the thread - level features , the classifier can consider that there is a dialogue between u 1 and u 2 , causing all the comments to be assigned to the correct class : bad .
In the second example ( Q u 4 ) , the first two comments are classified as bad when using the basic features .
However , the third comment - written by the same user who asked Q u 4 - includes an acknowledgment .
The latter is propagated to the previous comments in terms of a thread feature , which indicates that such comments are more likely to be good answers .
This feature provides the classifier with enough information to properly label the first two comments as good .
Conclusions
We presented a study on using dependencies between the different answers in the same question thread in the context of answer selection in cQA .
Our experiments with different classifiers , features , and experimental conditions , reveal that answer dependencies are helpful to improve results on the task .
Such dependencies are best exploited by means of carefully designed thread - level features , whereas sequence label information alone , e.g. , used in CRF or SVM hmm , is not effective .
In future work , we plan to ( i ) experiment with more sophisticated thread - level features , as well as with other features that model context in general ; ( ii ) try data from other cQA websites , e.g. , where dialogue between users is marked explicitly ; and finally , ( iii ) integrate sequence , precedence , dependency information with globalthread - level - features in a unified framework .

The task organizers report that some comments in the threads were discarded due to disagreement in the annotation process .
The extent of discarded comments is unknown .
Varying regularization strength ( variance of the prior ) did not make much difference .
