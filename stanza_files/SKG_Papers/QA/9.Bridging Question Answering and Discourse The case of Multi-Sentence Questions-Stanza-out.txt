Bridging Question Answering and Discourse :
The case of Multi-Sentence Questions
abstract
In human question - answering ( QA ) , questions are often expressed in the form of multiple sentences .
One can see this in both spoken QA interactions , when one person asks a question of another , and written QA , such as are found on -line in FAQs and in what are called " Community Question - Answering Forums " .
Computer - based QA has taken the challenge of these " multi-sentence questions " to be that of breaking them into an appropriately ordered sequence of separate questions , with both the previous questions and their answers serving as context for the next question .
This can be seen , for example , in two recent workshops at AAAI called " Reasoning for Complex QA " [ https://rcqa-ws.github.io/program/].
We claim that , while appropriate for some types of " multi-sentence questions " ( MSQs ) , it is not appropriate for all , because they are essentially different types of discourse .
To support this claim , we need to provide evidence that : ? different types of MSQs are answered differently in written or spoken QA between people ; ? people can ( and do ) distinguish these different types of MSQs ; ? systems can be made to both distinguish different types of MSQs and provide appropriate answers .
