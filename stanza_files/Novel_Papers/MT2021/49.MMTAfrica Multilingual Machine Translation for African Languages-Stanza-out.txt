MMTAfrica : Multilingual Machine Translation for African Languages
abstract
In this paper , we focus on the task of multilingual machine translation for African languages and describe our contribution in the 2021 WMT Shared Task : Large - Scale Multilingual Machine Translation .
We introduce MMTAfrica , the first many - to -many multilingual translation system for six African languages : Fon ( fon ) , Igbo ( ibo ) , Kinyarwanda ( kin ) , Swahili / Kiswahili ( swa ) , Xhosa ( xho ) , and Yoruba ( yor ) and two non-African languages : English ( eng ) and French ( fra ) .
For multilingual translation concerning African languages , we introduce a novel backtranslation and reconstruction objective , BT&REC , inspired by the random online back translation and T5 modelling framework respectively , to effectively leverage monolingual data .
Additionally , we report improvements from MMTAfrica over the FLORES 101 benchmarks ( spBLEU gains ranging from + 0.58 in Swahili to French to + 19.46 in French to Xhosa ) .
In this paper , we make use of the following notations : ? refers to any language in the set {eng , f ra , ibo , f on , swa , kin , xho , yor } .
? refers to any language in the set {eng , f ra , ibo , f on} . ? AL ( s ) refers to African language ( s ) .
? X ? Y refers to neural machine translation from language X to language Y .
Introduction
Despite the progress of multilingual machine translation ( MMT ) and the many efforts towards improving its performance for low-resource languages , African languages suffer from under-representation .
For example , of the 2000 known African languages ( Eberhard et al. , 2020 ) only 17 of them are available in the FLORES 101 Large-scale Multilingual Translation Task as at the time of this research .
Furthermore , most research that look into transfer learning of multlilingual models from high- resource to low-resource languages rarely work with ALs in the low-resource scenario .
While the consensus is that the outcome of the research made using the low-resource non-African languages should be scalable to African languages , this cross-lingual generalization is not guaranteed ( Orife et al. , 2020 ) and the extent to which it actually works remains largely understudied .
Transfer learning from African languages to African languages sharing the same language sub-class has been shown to give better translation quality than from high- resource Anglo-centric languages ( Nyoni and Bassett , 2021 ) calling for the need to investigate AL ?
AL multilingual translation .
This low representation of African languages goes beyond machine translation Joshi et al. , 2020 ; . The analysis conducted by ?
et al. ( 2020 ) revealed that low-resourcedness of African languages can be traced to the poor incorporation of African languages in the NLP research community ( Joshi et al. , 2020 ) .
All these call for the inclusion of more African languages in multilingual NLP research and experiments .
With the high linguistic diversity in Africa , multilingual machine translation systems are very important for inter-cultural communication , which is in turn necessary for peace and progress .
For example , one widely growing initiative to curb the large gap in scientific research in Africa is to translate educational content and scientific papers to various African languages in order to reach far more African native speakers ( Abbott and Mart-inus , 2018 ; Nordling , 2018 ; Wild , 2021 ) .
We take a step towards addressing the underrepresentation of African languages in MMT and improving experiments by participating in the 2021 WMT Shared Task : Large - Scale Multilingual Machine Translation with a major target of ALs ?
ALs .
In this paper , we focused on 6 African languages and 2 non-African languages ( English and French ) .
Table 1 gives an overview of our focus African languages in terms of their language family , number of speakers and the regions in Africa where they are spoken ( Adelani et al. , 2021 b ) .
We chose these languages in an effort to create some language diversity : the 6 African languages span the most widely and least spoken languages in Africa .
Additionally , they have some similar , as well as contrasting , characteristics which offer interesting insights for future work in ALs : ? Igbo , Yor ?b? and Fon use diacritics in their language structure while Kinyarwanda , Swahili and Xhosa do not .
Various forms of code-mixing are prevalent in Igbo ( Dossou and Emezue , 2021 b ) .
?
Fon was particularly chosen because there is only a minuscule amount of online ( parallel or monolingual ) corpora compared to the other 5 languages .
We wanted to investigate and provide valuable insights on improving translation quality of very low-resourced African languages .
? Kinyarwanda and Fon are the only African languages in our work not covered in the FLO - RES Large - Scale Multilingual Machine Translation Task and also not included in the pretraining of the original model framework used for MMTAfrica .
Based on this , we were able to understand the performance of multilingual translation finetuning involving languages not used in the original pretraining objective .
We also offered a method to improve the translation quality of such languages .
Our main contributions are summarized below : 1 . MMTAfrica - a many- to- many AL ?
AL multilingual model for 6 African languages .
2 . Our novel reconstruction objective ( described in section 4.2 ) and the BT&REC finetuning setting , together with our proposals in section 5.1 offer a comprehensive strategy for effectively exploiting monolingual data of African languages in AL ?
AL multilingual machine translation , 3 . Evaluation of MMTAfrica on the FLORES Test Set reports significant gains in spBLEU over the M2M MMT ( Fan et al. , 2020 ) benchmark model provided by Goyal et al . ( 2021 ) , 4 . We further created a unique highly representative test set - MMTAfrica Test Setand reported benchmark results and insights using MMTAfrica .
The great success of the encoderdecoder ( Sutskever et al. , 2014 ; Cho et al. , 2014 ) NMT on bilingual datasets ( Bahdanau et al. , 2015 ; Vaswani et al. , 2017 ; Barrault et al. , 2019
Barrault et al. , , 2020 inspired the extension of the original bilingual framework to handle more languages pairs simultaneously - leading to multilingual neural machine translation .
Works on multilingual NMT have progressed from sharing the encoder for one- to -many translation ( Dong et al. , 2015 ) , many - to- one translation ( Lee et al. , 2017 ) , sharing the attention mechanism across multiple language pairs ( Firat et al. , 2016a ; Dong et al. , 2015 ) to optimizing a single NMT model ( with a universal encoder and decoder ) for the translation of multiple language pairs ( Ha et al. , 2016 ; Johnson et al. , 2017 ) .
The universal encoder-decoder approach constructs a shared vocabulary for all languages in the training set , and uses just one encoder and decoder for multilingual translation between language pairs .
Johnson et al. ( 2017 ) proposed to use a single model and prepend special symbols to the source text to indicate the target language .
We adopt their model approach in this paper .
The current state of multilingual NMT , where a single NMT model is optimized for the translation of multiple language pairs ( Firat et al. , 2016a ; Johnson et al. , 2017 ; Lu et al. , 2018 ; Aharoni et al. , 2019 ; Arivazhagan et al. , 2019 b ) , has become very appealing for a number of reasons .
It is scalable and easy to deploy or maintan ( the ability of a single model to effectively handle all translation directions from N languages , if properly trained and designed , surpasses the scalability of O( N 2 ) individually trained models using the traditional bilingual framework ) .
Multilingual NMT can encourage knowledge transfer among related language pairs ( Lakew et al. , 2018 ; Tan et al. , 2019 ) as well as positive transfer from higher - resource languages ( Zoph et al. , 2016 ; Neubig and Hu , 2018 ; Arivazhagan et al. , 2019a ; Aharoni et al. , 2019 ; Johnson et al. , 2017 ) due to its shared representation , improve low-resource translation ( Ha et al. , 2016 ; Johnson et al. , 2017 ; Arivazhagan et al. , 2019 b ; Xue et al. , 2021 ) and enable zero-shot translation ( i.e. direct translation between a language pair never seen during training ) ( Firat et al. , 2016 b ; Johnson et al. , 2017 ) .
Despite the many advantages of multilingual NMT it suffers from certain disadvantages .
Firstly , the output vocabulary size is typically fixed regardless of the number of languages in the corpus and increasing the vocabulary size is costly in terms of computational resources because the training and inference time scales linearly with the size of the decoder 's output layer .
For example , the training dataset for all the languages in our work gave a total vocabulary size of 1 , 683 , 884 tokens ( 1 , 519 , 918 with every sentence lowercased ) but we were constrained to a decoder vocabulary size of 250 , 000 .
Another pitfall of massively multilingual NMT is its poor zero-shot performance ( Firat et al. , 2016 b ; Arivazhagan et al. , 2019a ; Johnson et al. , 2017 ; Aharoni et al. , 2019 ) , particularly compared to pivot-based models ( two bilingual models that translate from source to target language through an intermediate language ) .
Neural machine translation is heavily reliant on parallel data and so without access to parallel training data for zero-shot language pairs , multilingual models face the spurious correlation issue ( Gu et al. , 2019 ) and off-target translation ( Johnson et al. , 2017 ) where the model ignores the given target information and translates into a wrong language .
Some approaches to improve the performance ( including zero-shot translation ) of multilingual models have relied on leveraging the plentiful source and target side monolingual data that are available .
For example , generating artificial parallel data with various forms of backtranslation ( Sennrich et al. , 2015 ) has been shown to greatly improve the overall ( and zero-shot ) performance of multilingual models ( Firat et al. , 2016 b ; Gu et al. , 2019 ; Lakew et al. , 2018 ; Zhang et al. , 2020 ) as well as bilingual models ( Edunov et al. , 2018 ) .
Zhang et al. ( 2020 ) proposed random online backtranslation to enhance multilingual translation of unseen training language pairs .
Additionally , leveraging monolingual data by jointly learning to reconstruct the input while translating has been shown to improve neural machine translation quality ( F?vry and Phang , 2018 ; Lample et al. , 2017 ; Cheng et al. , 2016 ; Zhang and Zong , 2016 ) .
Siddhant et al. ( 2020 ) leveraged monolingual data in a semi-supervised fashion and reported three major results :
1 . Using monolingual data significantly boosts the translation quality of low resource languages in multilingual models .
2 . Self-supervision improves zero-shot translation quality in multilingual models .
3 . Leveraging monolingual data with selfsupervision provides a viable path towards adding new languages to multilingual models .
Data Methodology
Table 2 presents the size of the gathered and cleaned parallel sentences for each language direction .
We devised preprocessing guidelines for each of our focus languages taking their linguistic properties into consideration .
We used a maximum sequence length of 50 ( due to computational resources ) and a minimum of 2 .
In the following sections we will describe the data sources for the the parallel and monolingual corpora .
Parallel Corpora :
As NMT models are very reliant on parallel data , we sought to gather more parallel sentences for each language direction in an effort to increase the size and domain of each language direction .
To this end , our first source was JW300 ( Agi? and Vuli? , 2019 ) , a parallel corpus of 2 : Number of parallel samples for each language direction .
We highlight the largest and smallest parallel samples .
We see for example that much more research on machine translation and data collation has been carried out on swa?eng than fon ?
fra , attesting to the under-representation of some African languages .
over 300 languages with around 100 thousand biblical domain parallel sentences per language pair on average .
Using OpusTools ( Aulamo et al. , 2020 ) we were able to get only very trustworthy translations by setting t = 1.5 ( t is a threshold which indicates the confidence of the translations ) .
We collected more parallel sentences from Tatoeba 1 , kde4 2 ( Tiedemann , 2012 ) , and some English - based bilingual samples from MultiParaCrawl 3 . Finally , following pointers from the native speakers of these focus languages in the Masakhane community ( ?
et al. , 2020 ) to existing research on machine translation for African languages which opensourced their parallel data , we assembled more parallel sentences mostly in the {en , f r} ?
AL direction .
From all this we created MMTAfrica Test Set ( explained in more details in section 3.1 ) , got 5 , 424 , 578 total training samples for all languages directions ( a breakdown of data size for each language direction is provided in Table 2 ) and 4 , 000 for dev .
Monolingual Corpora : Despite our efforts to gather several parallel data from various domains , we were faced with some problems : 1 ) there was a huge imbalance in parallel samples across the language directions .
In Table 2 we see that the ? fon direction has the least amount of parallel sentences while ? swa or ? yor is made up of relatively larger parallel sentences .
2 ) 1 https://opus.nlpl.eu/Tatoeba.php 2 https://huggingface.co/datasets/kde4 3 https://www.paracrawl.eu/ the parallel sentences particularly for AL ?
AL span a very small domain ( mostly biblical , internet )
We therefore set out to gather monolingual data from diverse sources .
As our focus is on African languages , we collated monolingual data in only these languages .
The monolingual sources and volume are summarized in Table 3 .
Data Set Types in our Work
Here we elaborate on the different categories of data set that we ( generated and ) used in our work for training and evaluation .
where the model is fed some text prefix for context or conditioning and is then asked to produce some output text .
This framework makes it straightforward to design a number of NLP tasks like machine translation , summarization , text classification , etc .
Also , it provides a consistent training objective both for pre-training and finetuning .
The mT5 model was pre-trained with a maximum likelihood objective using " teacher forcing " ( Williams and Zipser , 1989 ) .
The mT5 model was also pretrained with a modification of the masked language modelling objective ( Devlin et al. , 2018 ) .
We finetuned the mt5 - base model on our many - to - many machine translation task .
While Xue et al . ( 2021 ) suggest that higher versions of the mT5 model ( Large , XL or XXL ) give better performance on downstream multilingual translation tasks , we were constrained by computational resources to mt5 - base , which has 580M parameters .
Setup For each language direction X ?
Y we have its set of n parallel sentences D = {( x i , y i ) }
n i=1 where x i is the ith source sentence of language X and y i is its translation in the target language Y . Following the approach of Johnson et al . ( 2017 ) and Xue et al . ( 2021 ) , we model translation in a text - to - text format .
More specifically , we create the input for the model by prepending the target language tag to the source sentence .
Therefore for each source sentence x i the input to the model is < Y tag > x i and the target is y i .
Taking a real example , let 's say we wish to translate the Igbo sentence Daalu . maka ikwu eziokwu nke Chineke to English .
The input to the model becomes < eng > Daalu . maka ikwu eziokwu nke Chineke .
Training
We have a set of language tags L for the languages we are working with in our multilingual many - to -many translation .
In our baseline setup ( section 4.4.1 )
L = {eng , f ra , ibo , f on } and in our final experiment ( section 4.4.2 )
L = {eng , f ra , ibo , f on , swa , kin , xho , yor} .
We carried out many - to -many translation using all the possible directions from L except eng ?
f ra .
We skipped eng ?
f ra for this fundamental reason : ? our main focus is on African ?
African or {eng , f ra} ? African .
Due to the high-resource nature of English and French , adding the training set for eng ?
f ra would overshadow the learning of the other language directions and greatly impede our analyses .
Our intuition draws from the observation of Xue et al . ( 2021 ) as the reason for off-target translation in the mT5 model : as English - based finetuning proceeds , the model 's assigned likelihood of non-English tokens presumably decreases .
Therefore since the mt5 - base training set contained predominantly English ( and after other European languages ) tokens and our research is about AL ?
AL translation , removing the eng ?
f ra direction was our way of ensuring the model designated more likelihood to AL tokens .
Our Contributions
In addition to the parallel data between the African languages , we leveraged monolingual data to improve translation quality in two ways : 1 . our backtranslation ( BT ) :
We designed a modified form of the random online backtranslation ( Zhang et al. , 2020 ) where instead of randomly selecting a subset of languages to backtranslate , we selected for each language num_bt sentences at random from the monolingual data set .
This means that the model gets to backtranslate different ( monolingual ) sentences every backtranslation time and in so doing , we believe , improve the model 's domain adaptation because it gets to learn from various samples from the whole monolingual data set .
We initially tested different values of num_bt to find a compromise between backtranslation computation time and translation quality .
Following research works which have shown the effectiveness of random beam-search over greedy decoding while generating backtranslations ( Lample et al. , 2017 ; Edunov et al. , 2018 ; Hoang et al. , 2018 ; Zhang et al. , 2020 ) , we generated num_sample prediction sentences from the model and randomly selected ( with equal probability ) one for our backtranslated sentence .
Naturally the value of num_sample further affects the computation time ( because the model has to produce num_sample different output sentences for each input sentence ) and so we finally settled with num_sample = 2 . 2 . our reconstruction : Given a monolingual sentence x m from language m , we applied random swapping ( 2 times ) and deletion ( with a probability of 0.2 ) to get a noisy version x .
Taking inspiration from Raffel et al. ( 2019 ) we integrated the reconstruction objective into our model finetuning by prepending the language tag < m > to x and setting its target output to x m .
Experiments
In all our experiments we initialized the pretrained mT5 - base model using Hugging Face 's Auto-ModelForSeq2SeqLM 6 and tracked the training process with Weights &Biases ( Biewald , 2020 ) .
We used the AdamW optimizer ( Loshchilov and Hutter , 2017 ) with a learning rate ( lr ) of 3e ?6 and transformer 's get_linear_schedule_with_warmup 7 scheduler ( where the learning rate decreases linearly from the initial lr set in the optimizer to 0 , after a warmup period and then increases linearly from 0 to the initial lr set in the optimizer . )
Baseline
The goal of our baseline was to understand the effect of jointly finetuning with backtranslation and reconstruction on the African ?
African language translation quality in two scenarios : when the AL was initially pretrained on the multilingual model and contrariwise .
Using Fon ( which was not initially included in the pretraining ) and Igbo ( which was initially included in the pretraining ) as the African languages for our baseline training , we finetuned our model on a many - to - many translation in all directions of {eng , f ra , ibo , f on} / eng ?
f ra amounting to 10 directions .
We used the Baseline Train Set for training and the Baseline Test Set for evaluation .
We trained the model for only 3 epochs in three settings : 1 . BASE : in this setup we finetune the model on only the many - to -many translation task : no backtranslation nor reconstruction .
2 . BT : refers to finetuning with our backtranslation objective described in section 4.2 .
For our 6 https://huggingface.co/transformers/ model_doc/auto.html#transformers .
AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM
7 https://huggingface.co/transformers/ main_classes/optimizer_schedules.html# transformers.get_linear_schedule_with_ warmup baseline , where we backtranslate using monolingual data in { ibo , f on} , we set num_bt = 500 .
For our final experiments , we first tried with 500 but finally reduced to 100 due to the great deal of computation required .
For our baseline experiment , we ran one epoch normally and the remaining two with backtranslation .
For our final experiments , we first finetuned the model on 3 epochs before continuing with backtranslation .
3 . BT&REC : refers to joint backtranslation and reconstruction ( explained in section 4.2 ) while finetuning .
Two important questions were addressed - 1 ) the ratio , backtranslation : reconstruction , of monolingual sentences to use and 2 ) whether to use the same or different sentences for backtranslation and reconstruction .
Bearing computation time in mind , we resolved to go with 500 : 50 for our baseline and 100 : 50 for our final experiments .
We leave ablation studies on the effect of the ratio on translation quality to future work .
For the second question we decided to randomly sample ( with replacement ) different sentences each for our backtranslation and reconstruction .
For our baseline , we used a learning rate of 5e ?4 , a batch size of 32 sentences , with gradient accumulation up to a batch of 256 sentences and an early stopping patience of 100 evaluation steps .
To further analyse the performance of our baseline setups we ran comparemt 8 ( Neubig et al. , 2019 ) on the model 's predictions .
MMTAfrica MMTAfrica refers to our final experimental setup where we finetuned our model on all language directions involving all eight languages L = {eng , f ra , ibo , f on , swa , kin , xho , yor} except eng ?
fra .
Taking inspiration from our baseline results we ran our experiment with our proposed BT&REC setting and made some adjustments along the way .
The long computation time for backtranslating ( with just 100 sentences per language the model was required to generate around 3 , 000 translations every backtranslation time ) was a drawback .
To mitigate the issue we parallelized the process us-ing the multiprocessing package in Python 9 .
We further slowly reduced the number of sentences for backtranslation ( to 50 , and finally 10 ) .
Gradient descent in large multilingual models has been shown to be more stable when updates are performed over large batch sizes are used ( Xue et al. , 2021 ) .
To cope with our computational resources , we used gradient accumulation to increase updates from an initial batch size of 64 sentences , up to a batch gradient computation size of 4096 sentences .
We further utilized PyTorch 's DataParallel package 10 to parallelize the training across the GPUs .
We used a learning rate ( lr ) of 3e ?6
Results and Insights
All evaluations were made using spBLEU ( sentencepiece ( Kudo and Richardson , 2018 ) + sacre- BLEU ( Post , 2018 ) ) as described in ( Goyal et al. , 2021 ) .
We further evaluated on the chrF ( Popovi ? , 2015 ) and TER metrics .
Baseline Results and Insights Figure 1 compares the spBLEU scores for the three setups used in our baseline experiments .
As a reminder , we make use of the symbol to refer to any language in the set {eng , f ra , ibo , f on} .
BT gives strong improvement over BASE ( except in eng ? ibo where it 's relatively the same , and fra?ibo where it performs worse ) .
When the target language is fon , we observe a considerable boost in the spBLEU of the BT setting , which also significantly outperformed BASE and BT&REC . BT&REC contributed very little when compared with BT and sometimes even performed poorly ( in eng?fon ) .
We attribute this poor performance from the reconstruction objective to the fact that the mt5 - base model was not originally pretrained on Fon .
Therefore , with only 3 epochs of finetuning ( and 1 epoch before introducing the reconstruction and backtranslation objectives ) the model was not able to meaningfully utilize both objectives .
Conversely , when the target language is ibo BT&REC gives best results - even in scenarios where BT underperforms BASE ( as is the case of fra?ibo and eng ?ibo ) .
We believe that the decoder of the model , being originally pretrained on corpora containing Igbo , was able to better use our reconstruction to improve translation quaity in ? ibo direction .
Drawing insights from fon ? ibo we offer the following propositions concerning AL ?
AL multilingual translation : ? our backtranslation ( section 4.2 ) from monolingual data improves the cross-lingual mapping of the model for low-resource African languages .
While it is computationally expensive , our parallelization and decay of number of backtranslated sentences are some potential solutions towards effectively adopting backtranslation using monolingual data .
?
Denoising objectives typically have been known to improve machine translation quality ( Zhang and Zong , 2016 ; Cheng et al. , 2016 ; Gu et al. , 2019 ; Zhang et al. , 2020 ; Xue et al. , 2021 ) because they imbue the model with more generalizable knowledge ( about that language ) which is used by the decoder to predict better token likelihoods for that language during translation .
This is a reasonable explanation for the improved quality with the BT&REC over BT in the ?ibo .
As we learned from ? fon , using reconstruction could perform unsatisfactorily if not handled well .
Some methods we propose are : 1 . For African languages that were included in the original model pretraining ( as was the case of Igbo , Swahili , Xhosa , and Yor ?b? in the mT5 model ) , using the BT&REC setting for finetuning produces best results .
While we did not perform ablation studies on the data size ratio for backtranslation and reconstruction , we believe that our ratio of 2 : 1 ( in our final experiments ) gives the best compromise on both computation time and translation quality .
2 . For African languages that were not originally included in the original model pretraining ( as was the case of Kinyarwanda and Fon in the mT5 model ) , reconstruction together with backtranslation ( especially at an early stage ) only introduces more noise which could harm the crosslingual learning .
For these languages we propose : ( a ) first finetuning the model on only our reconstruction ( described in section 4.2 ) for fairly long training steps before using BT&REC .
This way , the initial reconstruction will help the model learn that language representation space and increase its the likelihood of tokens .
MMTAfrica Results and Insights In Table 4 , we compared MMTAfrica with the M2M MMT ( Fan et al. , 2020 ) benchmark results of Goyal et al . ( 2021 ) using the same test set they used - FLORES Test Set .
On all language pairs except swa?eng ( which has a comparable ?2.76 spBLEU difference ) , we report an improvement from MMTAfrica ( spBLEU gains ranging from + 0.58 in swa?
fra to + 19.46 in fra?xho ) .
The lower score of swa?eng presents an intriguing anomaly , especially given the large availability of parallel corpora in our training set for this pair .
We plan to investigate this in further work .
In Table 5 we introduce benchmark results of MMTAfrica on MMTAfrica Test Set .
We also put the test size of each language pair .
Interesting analysis about Fon ( fon ) and Yor ?b? ( yor ) :
For each language , the lowest sp - BLEU scores in both tables come from the ? yor direction , except fon ?
yor ( from Table 5 ) which interestingly has the highest spBLEU score compared to the other fon ?
directions .
We do not know the reason for the very low performance in the ? yor direction , but we offer below a plausible explanation about fon ?
yor .
The oral linguistic history of Fon ties it to the ancient Yor ?b? kingdom ( Barnes , 1997 ) .
Furthermore , in present day Benin , where Fon is largely spoken as a native language , Yoruba is one of the indigenuous languages commonly spoken .
11 Therefore Fon and Yor ?b? share some linguistic characteristics and we believe this is one logic behind the fon ?
yor surpassing other fon ?
directions .
This explanation could inspire transfer learning from Yor ?b? , which has received comparably more research and has more resources for machine translation , to Fon .
We leave this for future work .
( Orife et al. , 2020 ) and beyond .
In order to fully test the advantage of MMTAfrica , we plan to finish comparing it on direct and pivot translations with the Masakhane benchmark models ( ?
et al. , 2020 ) .
We also plan to perform human evaluation .

In this paper , we introduced MMTAfrica , a mul- tilingual machine translation model on 6 African Languages , which outperformed the M2M MMT model Fan et al . ( 2020 ) .
Our results and analy - ses , including a new reconstruction objective , give insights on MMT for African languages for fu- ture research .
Moreover , we plan to launch the model on Masakhane MT and FFRTranslate in or - der to get human evaluation feedback from the actual speakers of the languages in the Masakhane community

Model and Experiments 4.1 ModelFor all our experiments , we used the mT5 model ( Xue et al. , 2021 ) , a multilingual variant of the encoder-decoder , transformer - based ( Vaswani et al. , 2017 ) " Text - to- Text Transfer Transformer " ( T5 ) model ( Raffel et al. , 2019 ) .
In T5 pre-training , the NLP tasks ( including machine translation ) were cast into a " text-to- text " format - that is , a task 4 https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/ flores101/dataset/flores101_dataset.tar. gz 5 https://cloud.google.com/translate
