Findings of the WMT 2021 Shared Task on Large-Scale Multilingual Machine Translation
abstract
The results of all shared tasks were announced at the conference , and these proceedings also include overview papers for the shared tasks , summarizing the results , as well as providing information about the data used and any procedures that were followed in conducting or scoring the tasks .
In addition , there are short papers from each participating team that describe their underlying system in greater detail .
Like in previous years , we have received a far larger number of submissions than we could accept for presentation .
WMT 2021 has received 49 full research paper submissions ( not counting withdrawn submissions ) .
In total , WMT 2021 featured 18 full research paper presentations and 96 shared task presentations .
The event hosted a panel discussion led by Markus Freitag ( Google ) on evaluation with Nitika Mathur ( Univ. Melbourne ) , Benjamin Marie ( NICT ) , Ricardo Rei ( Unbabel ) , Tom Kocmi ( Microsoft ) .
We would like to thank the members of the Program Committee for their timely reviews .
We also would like to thank the participants of the shared task and all the other volunteers who helped with the evaluations .
