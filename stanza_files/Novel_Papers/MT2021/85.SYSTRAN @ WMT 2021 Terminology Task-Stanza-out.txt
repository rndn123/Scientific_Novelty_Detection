SYSTRAN @ WMT 2021 : Terminology Task
abstract
This paper describes SYSTRAN submissions to the WMT 2021 terminology shared task .
We participate in the English-to - French translation direction with a standard Transformer neural machine translation network that we enhance with the ability to dynamically include terminology constraints , a very common industrial practice .
Two state - of - the - art terminology insertion methods are evaluated based ( i ) on the use of placeholders complemented with morphosyntactic annotation and ( ii ) on the use of target constraints injected in the source stream .
Results show the suitability of the presented approaches in the evaluated scenario where terminology is used in a system trained on generic data only .
Introduction
The high quality obtained by out - of - the - box neural machine translation ( NMT ) systems ( Bojar et al. , 2016 ) has boosted the adoption of automatic translation by the industry and invigorated the research and development on domain adaption and integration of technology in human translation workflows .
For instance , combination with translation memories ( Bulte and Tezcan , 2019 ; Pham et al. , 2020 ) , terminology handling ( Hasler et al. , 2018 ; Dinu et al. , 2019 ; Michon et al. , 2020 ; Bergmanis and Pinnis , 2021 ) , interactive translation ( Peris and Casacuberta , 2019 ) , post-editing modelling ( Chatterjee et al. , 2020 ) or dynamic adaptation ( Farajian et al. , 2017 ) are all different techniques to make machine translation part of reallife localization workflow .
Terminology resources with all their sophistication have been the core building bricks and a continuous challenge to acquire in volume ( Senellart et al. , 2003 ) for rule- based engines .
At the other extreme , they have been reduced to corpus or aligned " phrase pairs " ( Schwenk et al. , 2008 ) for Statistical Machine Translation approaches , missing most of their intrinsic linguistic properties .
In contrast , neural machine translation operates on word and sentence representations in a continuous space so , on the one hand , it has access to deep actual linguistic knowledge ( Conneau et al. , 2018 ) and demonstrates a huge ability to generalize .
But on the other hand , results are more difficult to interpret ( Koehn and Knowles , 2017 ) , and subsequently the translation process is far more complicated to control .
Therefore , as for several other linguistic annotations , the challenge is how terminological information can be " passed " to the model .
From a human perspective , even though presentation and usage of dictionaries have evolved from ontology ( as found in paper dictionary ) to corpus-based presentation , looking up terms in a dictionary is the ultimate point of reference for validating the correct term for a specific domain and context .
Inline with the conditions of the WMT 2021 terminology shared task , we present English - to - French NMT engines built from abundant generic ( out - of- domain ) training data .
We evaluate several methods to enhance translation engines with the ability to integrate terminology as a quick way to dynamically specialize a translation to a particular domain , which in this case considers the new COVID -19 domain and the large efforts for translation of critical information regarding pandemic handling and infection prevention strategies .
Indomain resources are limited to word - and phraselevel terminology entries created to guide professional translators to ensure both accuracy and consistency in translations .
Our generic systems make only use of terminologies at inference time .
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows : Section 2 gives details of several terminology injection approaches considered in this work .
In addition , we outline a grammatical error correction network that is applied over French translation hypotheses .
The experimental framework is presented in Section 3 .
Results are discussed in Section 4 .
Finally , we draw conclusions in Section 5 .
Terminology Injection
Terminology is typically defined as the technical or special terms used in a business , art , science , or special subject .
A high quality asset maintained by language specialists as part of a translation project .
It allows to guarantee language consistency , certify translation accuracy and define constraints to human translation .
In recent years there has been significant work proposing methods to integrate such external specialized terminologies into NMT models , each showing different levels of performance when facing terminology injection issues , mainly inference overhead and generalization power .
In this section we describe the two main methods employed for this shared task and illustrate the particularities of each on a common scenario using two English - French terminology entries : Coronavirus ?
Coronavirus and pneumonia ? pneumonie , in the following translation :
Coronavirus can cause pneumonia
Les coronavirus peuvent causer des pneumonies Table 1 illustrates training examples of each terminology injection methods evaluated in this work .
First row shows the base configuration where no terminology is employed .
Placeholders
Our first method incorporates non-terminal tokens into NMT systems , which require modifying the pre-and post-processing of the data , and training the system with data that contains the same placeholders which occur in the test sets ( Crego et al. , 2016 ; Michon et al. , 2020 ) .
Following our example , source and translation terms appearing in the sentence pair are replaced by placeholders adapted to cover a wider variety of cases , and to control morphology to allow generalization power .
The method presented in Michon et al . ( 2020 ) allows handling very challenging cases concerning homographs .
This is , words ( or phrases ) that sharing the same form ( i.e. spread ) can occur with multiple meanings or different grammatical functions ( verb or noun ) .
The method predicts the part-ofspeech of the target placeholder .
Thus , solving the source homograph .
Given that the vast majority of the terminology released for this shared task consists of nouns ( single words or phrases ) we decided to use a simplified version of the method that only considers using noun placeholders .
Row mrk in Table 1 illustrates the use of placeholders for our previous training example .
Each word form detected as terminology is replaced by two placeholders :
The first indicates the part-ofspeech of the terminology ( in this work always a noun ' N ' ) followed by a unique identifier ; the second indicates the set of features conveying the morphology of the noun ( masc / fem and sing / plur ) .
To predict the target morphology of the each term , the NMT model may find it useful to have access to the source word form .
Thus , in a second version of the method we incorporate the terminology word form ( Coronaviruses and pneumonia ) in the source stream .
We denote this version mrk + .
It is worth to notice that this second version only improves on the previous when the incorporated source term has sufficiently occurred in training .
Note also that Michon et al . ( 2020 ) do not require linguistic information in inference since ambiguities are not resolved in the source placeholders .
In contrast , our implementation uses SpaCy 1 to obtain part-of-speeches and morphology features of input streams .
Target - side streams of methods mrk and mrk+ , require post-processing to replace target - side placeholders by the final word forms .
In practice , for each source - target term pair we encode all possible inflections of the source and target word labelled with the corresponding inflection type ( placeholders ) .
Not only does this analysis enable to lexically match any inflected form of the source term , but it can also produce any inflected form of the translation term , ensuring full flexibility in the inflection choice made by the neural network .
Table 2 illustrates target word forms for the terminology pneumonia ? pneumonie .
Learning to apply constraints
This approach tackles the same problem by learning a copy behaviour of terminology at training time ( Song et al. , 2019 ; Dinu et al. , 2019 ; Bergmanis and Pinnis , 2021 ) .
The NMT model is trained to incorporate terminology translations when they are provided as additional input in the source sentence .
Terminology translations are inserted as inline annotations , expecting the model to learn that such additional words must be copied in the target hypothesis .
The authors insert terminology translations in the source sentence either by appending the target term to its source version , or by
Placeholders ( tgt ) Word form
< N> < fem_sing > pneumonie < N> < fem_plur > pneumonies Table 2 : Target word forms and associated placeholders for the term entry pneumonia ? pneumonie .
directly replacing the original term with the target one .
Example in row app of Table 1 illustrates the append alternative presented in Dinu et al . ( 2019 ) .
The approach uses a generic NMT architecture which learns to use an external terminology provided at run-time , thus , showing no inference overhead .
However , similarly to the preceding approach , it lacks generalization power as it simply " copies " the term found in the terminology base injected in the source sentence , irrespective of the target hypothesis context .
Dinu et al. ( 2019 ) argue that in some cases the approach exhibits the ability to inflect translation terms .
Finally , a second version of the method is also illustrated in Table 1 , denoted as app + .
The target term is injected using its lemma form .
Thus , forcing the NMT model to produce the right inflection of the term observed in the source stream .
In the example , pneumonie must be inflected in its plural form , pneumonies .
Tokens < b> , < i> and < e> are used to inform the model of the source and target terminology boundaries .
Note that , in contrast to placeholder methods , no additional post-processing is required .
Grammatical Error Correction
As previously stated , placeholder methods allow larger generalization power thanks to the flexibility of the inflection mechanism employed in the translation workflow .
However , morphology choices made by the network do not take into account the actual word forms , which was observed to result in a higher number of inflection errors ( Michon et al. , 2020 ) .
To alleviate this problem we add a correction module that performs over the resulting translation hypotheses .
We use a correction module based on Gector ( Omelianchuk et al. , 2020 ) with a pretrained multilingual BERT to correct grammatically incorrect French words .
The model predicts grammatical features for each word in the translated sentence , allowing only for 3 types of edits : ?
Transformation of gender / number le [ Fem ] ? la le [ Plur ] ? les ? transformation of tense / person of verbs avez [ 3 _ Plur ] ? avons avez [ Ind _Imp ] ? aviez ? Elision le [ ELISION ] ? l' Table 9 in Appendix B illustrates the vocabulary of tags considered by the model .
Once the model predicts whether a word needs to be corrected ( and which correction ) , the final word form is found using a dictionary and the predicted tag .
3 Experimental Framework
Corpora Table 7 in Appendix
A provides some statistics on the parallel corpora employed for training our models .
It is important to note that all corpora used are out-of- domain .
We first filtered out longer sentences and sentences with a significant difference in the number of words between the source and the corresponding translation .
All data is preprocessed using the OpenNMT tokenizer 2 . In order to train our correction ( GeC ) model with additional data , we also use the monolingual ( French ) corpora made available for the shared task .
See Table 8 in Appendix
A for detailed statistics of monolingual data .
Terminology
Table 4 illustrates some examples of the terminology entries released by the organisers of the shared task .

We note that most terminology entries are composed of several words .
Indeed 54.8 % of terms are groups of two words , 22.3 % contains more than three words and only 22.9 % are single words as measured in the source side .

NMT Engines
All our NMT engines follow the Transformer architecture ( Vaswani et al. , 2017 ) ( Sennrich et al. , 2016 ) learned from source and target corpora .
We train our MT models using Noam schedule ( Vaswani et al. , 2017 ) with 4000 warm - up iterations .
To balance between the domains of the training corpora , we use the following sampling distribution over the training corpora : ? ? ( d ) = q ?
d n d d=1 q ? d , ( 1 ) where q d is the size of d th corpora , the scalar ? ? [ 0 , +? ]
changes the sampling distribution as low ?
upsamples small corpora and downsamples large corpora while high ? favors large corpora over small corpora .
In the training of our MT systems , we use ? = 0.5 .
Learning is performed over 8 GPUs during 300 K steps with a batch size of 32 K tokens per step .
During training , we filtered out sentences larger than 250 tokens .
We applied label smoothing to the cross-entropy loss with a rate of 0.1 .
Resulting models are built after averaging the last ten checkpoints of the training process .
In inference , we apply a length penalty rate of 0.6 .
Training NMT
Terminology injection approaches implemented for this evaluation rely on NMT models with the ability to translate input streams with target terms ( app and app + ) and using placeholders ( mrk and mrk + ) .
Thus , a key step for our models is the availability of training data with such annotations .
To identify terminology pairs in our training database we : ? Analyse English and French using SpaCy to produce part-of-speeches , morphology features , noun phrases and lemmas .
Only NPs ( single words or phrases ) are considered .
?
Word align English and French parallel corpora using the fast_align 4 toolkit ( Dyer et al. , 2013 ) .
Terminology pairs are only considered when English and French sides consist of noun phrases and when words in a term are only aligned to words in its counterpart .
Words of the terminology entries identified are replaced by the corresponding tokens ( depending on the approach ) .
See Table 1 for examples of sentence pairs with terminology entries .
We make sure that a given sentence pair does not exceed 5 terminology entries .
Training GeC
We used all available French corpora to train our GeC network .
To include errors in the French streams we replace some words by any inflection of its base form ( lemma ) .
The resulting corpora is then tokenized using wordpiece and passed to the BERT language model for embedding .
Error detection and tagging are then performed by the network from subword embeddings .
Grammatical features , part-of-speeches and lemmas are performed by the SpaCy toolkit .
Table 3 illustrates examples of word error correction by our model .
Terms with Multiple Translations
Note that terms released by the shared task organisers may have multiple translation options ( i.e. quarantine ? quarantaine / mise en quarantaine ) .
Thus , the right translation must be predicted and injected in the translation hypothesis .
The translation workflow implemented for this evaluation considers the injection of each translation option into the input sentence .
This is , when a matched term is built with n different translation options , the original input sentence is copied n times and each translation is injected into one copy .
Once all copies have been translated , the one showing the lowest perplexity is selected as measured by the pretrained BERT French language model detailed in section 2.3 .
As it can be seen , the methods that learn to apply constraints ( app and app + ) obtain the best performance .
Overall , the GeC model succeeds in fixing grammatically incorrect French words .
However , a benefit barely reflected by BLEU .
Results
We now evaluate the performance of matching terminology entries over the development input sentences .
Note that the same matching method is always applied , detailed in Section 2.1 , where input sentences are matched against all possible inflections of source terms .
Table 6 illustrates the accuracy of recognized terms .
73 percent of the unrecognized terms are verbs which we choose to not process .
We recognized also 234 terms that are not highlighted in the development set ( FP ) , most of them do not interfere with translations .
Accuracy FN FP 0.97 0.03 0.21 Table 6 : Matching rates of terminology entries measured over the development set .
FN and FP scores stand respectively for false negatives ( terms not identified ) and false positives ( wrong terminology identifications ) .
Conclusions
We presented SYSTRAN English- to - French submissions to WMT 2021 terminology shared task .
All our systems follow the Transformer network architecture enhanced with the ability to dynamically include terminology constraints .
Several terminology injection methods were evaluated , showing their ability to effectively injecting terms while producing highly accurate translations .
