Multi-Modal Open-Domain Dialogue
abstract
Recent work in open-domain conversational agents has demonstrated that significant improvements in humanness and user preference can be achieved via massive scaling in both pre-training data and model size ( Adiwardana et al. , 2020 ; Roller et al. , 2020 ) .
However , if we want to build agents with human-like abilities , we must expand beyond handling just text .
A particularly important topic is the ability to see images and communicate about what is perceived .
With the goal of getting humans to engage in multi-modal dialogue , we investigate combining components from state - of - the - art open- domain dialogue agents with those from state - of - the - art vision models .
We study incorporating different image fusion schemes and domain-adaptive pre-training and fine-tuning strategies , and show that our best resulting model outperforms strong existing models in multi-modal dialogue while simultaneously performing as well as its predecessor ( text-only ) BlenderBot ( Roller et al. , 2020 ) in text - based conversation .
We additionally investigate and incorporate safety components in our final model , and show that such efforts do not diminish model performance with respect to human preference .
Introduction
An important goal of artificial intelligence is the construction of open-domain conversational agents that can engage humans in discourse .
Indeed , the future of human interaction with AI is predicated on models that can exhibit a number of different conversational skills over the course of rich dialogue .
Much recent work has explored building and training dialogue agents that can blend such skills throughout natural conversation , with the ultimate goal of providing an interesting and engrossing experience for humans Shuster et al. , 2019 b ) . Coupled with the advancement of * Joint First Authors .
large-scale model training schemes , such models are becoming increasingly human-like and engaging Adiwardana et al. , 2020 ; Roller et al. , 2020 ) .
In order to better approach human-like ability , however , it is necessary that agents can converse with both textual and visual context , similarly to how humans interact in the real world ; indeed , communication grounded in images is naturally engaging to humans ( Hu et al. , 2014 ) .
Recent efforts have gone beyond classical , fact - based tasks such as image captioning or visual question answering ( Antol et al. , 2015 ; Das et al. , 2017a ) to produce models that can respond and communicate about images in the flow of natural conversation ( Shuster et al. , , 2019 b .
In this work , we explore the extension of largescale conversational agents to image - based dia-logue .
We combine representations from imagebased models that have been trained on object detection tasks ( Lu et al. , , 2019 with representations from Transformers with billions of parameters pre-trained on massive ( text-only ) dialogue datasets , to produce responses conditioned on both visual and textual context .
To ensure that our model retains the ability to engage in regular , text - based conversation , we include in our training procedure multi-tasking with datasets expressly designed to instill conversational skills in the model .
We find that our best resulting models are as proficient in text-only conversation as the current best reported dialogue models , with respect to both performance on the relevant datasets and human evaluations of preference .
Concatenating image feature embeddings to the input of our model 's encoder leads to better performance than concatenating the embeddings to the encoder 's output , and using spatially based image embeddings performs better than single -vector embeddings .
Simultaneously , our model significantly outperforms recent strong multi-modal dialogue models when in an image-dialogue regime ; we measure several metrics via pairwise human judgments using ACUTE - Eval ( Li et al. , 2019 b ) to show that our model is not only more preferred by humans but can also discuss and reference visual context throughout a conversation .
See Figure 1 for one sample cherrypicked conversation with our model , with random and lemon-picked conversations in Figures 2 and 3 .
One important avenue we explore with our best models is safety - that is , ensuring that our models are not offensive to their conversational partners .
Dialogue safety is indeed a well - studied , but still unsolved , research area Liu et al. , 2019 ; Dinan et al. , 2019a ; Blodgett et al. , 2020 ; Khatri et al. , 2018 ; Sch?fer and Burtenshaw , 2019 ; Zhang et al. , 2018a ) , yet we note that safety in the context of image-dialogue is relatively less explored .
In this work we examine gender bias and toxicity of text generations in the context of various styles from the Image - Chat dataset .
Notably , after tuning the model to reduce toxicity and gender bias , we find that human preference for this model does not diminish .
The training procedure and initial pre-trained model weights will be made publicly available to allow for fully reproducible results .
Related Work
Multi-Modal Models and Tasks Rich Representations Modeling multi-modal inputs , i.e. in visual + textual contexts , is a wellresearched area .
Much of the existing literature explores similar architectures to our setup , i.e. , using standard Transformer - based models to jointly encode text and images ( Li et al. , 2019a ; Kiela et al. , 2019 ) .
Others have explored modifications to the standard self-attention scheme in Transformers by incorporating additional co-attention ( Lu et al. , 2019 ; Tan and Bansal , 2019 ) or cross-attention ( Stefanini et al. , 2020 ) layers .
These models have primarily been used for generating rich joint representations of images and text for use in downstream tasks , and primarily focus on the encoding aspect .
Visual Dialogue / Caption Generation
Many tasks have been designed to measure the ability of a model to produce text in the context of images .
Specifically , COCO Captions ( Chen et al. , 2015 ) and Flickr30 k ( Young et al. , 2014 ) require a model to produce a caption for a given image .
A variety of sequence-to-sequence ( Vinyals et al. , 2015 ; Xu et al. , 2015 ; Anderson et al. , 2018 ) and retrievalbased ( Gu et al. , 2018 ; Faghri et al. , 2018 ; Nam et al. , 2016 ) models have been applied to these tasks , however they do not go beyond the one-turn text generation expected for captioning an image .
Other recent architectures have explored text generation ( Wang et al. , 2020 ; Park et al. , 2020 ) in the context of the Visual Dialog ( Das et al. , 2017 b ) task ; however , this task is primarily used to measure the ability to answer questions about an image in the flow of a natural conversation , which differs somewhat from the open-domain dialogue task .
Further still , there have been recent forays into open-domain natural dialogue in the context of images , e.g. in the Image - Chat and Image - grounded Conversations ( Mostafazadeh et al. , 2017 ) tasks .
Again , retrieval - based ( Shuster et al. , 2020 Ju et al. , 2019 ) and sequence - tosequence ( Shuster et al. , 2019 b models have been used to conduct dialogue in this regime .
Multi-Task Training / Using Pre-Trained Representations
Our multi-modal model is constructed from models pre-trained in other , related domains ; specifically , we seek to fuse the resulting weights of large-scale , uni-modal pre-training to achieve good performance on downstream , multi-modal tasks .
Adapting pre-trained representations to later downstream tasks has been shown to be successful in NLP ( Peters et al. , 2019 ; Devlin et al. , 2019 ) and dialogue in particular ( Roller et al. , 2020 ; Mazar ?
et al. , 2018 ) , while large-scale multi-modal pretraining has been shown to be effective in other downstream multi-modal tasks Singh et al. , 2020 b ) .
Our work does not contain multi-modal pre-training in itself , but rather we explore " domain- adaptive pretraining " ( Gururangan et al. , 2020 ) or " intermediate task transfer " ( Pruksachatkun et al. , 2020 ) , in which pre-trained representations are " adapted " to a certain domain via an intermediate training step , before training / evaluating on the requisite downstream tasks .
We also employ multi-task training , to both help generalize the applicability of the model and improve its performance on downstream tasks / evaluations ; this has been shown recently to help in both image - based ( Singh et al. , 2020 b ; Ju et al. , 2019 ; ) and text - based ( Shuster et al. , 2019 b ; Roller et al. , 2020 ) tasks .
Comparison to Existing Models
In this work , we compare our best resulting model to several existing models in the literature .
BlenderBot : the 2.7- billion- parameter
Transformer sequence- to-sequence model from Roller et al . ( 2020 ) , known as " BST Generative 2.7B model " in that work , pre-trained on 1.5B comments from a third - party Reddit dump hosted by pushshift .
io ( Baumgartner et al. , 2020 ) .
We refer to this model as " BlenderBot " .
DialoGPT : a GPT - 2 - based model trained on 147M exchanges from public-domain social-media conversations .
Meena : a 2.6B - parameter
Transformer sequence- to-sequence model trained on 341 GB of conversations ( Adiwardana et al. , 2020 ) . Dodeca : the Image + Seq2Seq model from do-decaDialogue ( Shuster et al. , 2019 b ) , a Transformer sequence - to-sequence model in which the encoder is passed pre-trained image features from the ResNeXt -IG - 3.5B model ( Mahajan et al. , 2018 ) .
We use their model fine-tuned on Image - Chat ( and we refer to this model as " Dodeca " ) .
2 AMMC : a retrieval model in which multiple Transformers are attended over in order to make use of a combination of ResNeXt -IG - 3.5B and Faster R-CNN image features .
We specifically use the 2 AMMC model from Ju et al . ( 2019 ) because that model has the best test-set performance on Image - Chat in that work .
Model Architectures
The inputs to our models are visual and / or textual context , where applicable .
We explore different ways to encode images , and we additionally compare ways of combining ( fusing ) the image and text representations before outputting a response .
Image Encoders
Converting an image from pixels to a vector representation is a well - researched problem , and thus we explore using two different image encoders , using features taken from ResNeXt ( Mahajan et al. , 2018 ) and Faster R-CNN ( Ren et al. , 2017 ) , to determine the best fit for our tasks .
See Appendix
A for a description of these image encoders .
Multi-Modal Architecture
To jointly encode visual and textual context , we use a modification of a standard Transformer sequenceto-sequence architecture ( Vaswani et al. , 2017 ) , whereby we experiment with different ways of fusing the image and text representations to generate an output sequence .
Our Transformer model architecture follows that of Roller et al . ( 2020 ) , with 2 encoder layers , 24 decoder layers , 2560 dimensional embeddings , and 32 attention heads , and the weights are initialized from a 2.7 - billion parameter model pre-trained on 1.5B comments from a third - party Reddit dump hosted by pushshift .
io ( Baumgartner et al. , 2020 ) to generate a comment conditioned on the full thread leading up to the comment .
From this base model , we explore two possible fusion schemes .
Late Fusion
The late fusion method is the same as in Shuster et al . ( 2019 b ) , whereby the encoded image is projected to the same dimension as the text encoding of the Transformer encoder , concatenated with this output as an extra " token " output , and finally fed together as input to the decoder .
Early Fusion
We additionally experiment with an earlier fusion scheme to allow greater interaction between the image and text in the sequenceto-sequence architecture .
In a similar fashion to VisualBERT ( Li et al. , 2019a ) and multi-modal Bitransformers ( Kiela et al. , 2019 ) , we concatenate the projected image encoding from the visual input with the token embeddings from the textual input , assign each a different segment embedding , and jointly encode the text and image in the encoder .
1
The encoder thus performs full self-attention across the textual and visual context , with the entire output used as normal in the sequence - to-sequence architecture .
As our resulting model can be seen as a multimodal extension to the BlenderBot model ( Roller et al. , 2020 ) , we refer to it as " Multi-Modal BlenderBot " ( MMB ) .
Training Details
When training the model , we fix the weights of the pre-trained image encoders , except the linear projection to the Transformer output dimension , and fine- tune all of the weights of the Transformer encoder / decoder .
Domain-Adaptive Pre-Training During training , the vast majority of trainable model weights are initialized from a large , 2.7B parameter Transformer pre-trained solely on textual input .
As our end goal is to achieve improved performance on multi-modal tasks , we found that training first on domain-specific / related data was helpful in order to adapt the Transformer model to an image setting .
Following ( Singh et al. , 2020 b ) , we experimented with pre-training on COCO Captions ( Chen et al. , 2015 ) - a dataset of over 120k images with 5 captions each , resulting in over 600k utterances - in which the model is trained to generate a caption solely from image input .
We additionally explored multi-tasked training with COCO Captions and on the same third - party Reddit dump hosted by pushshift .
io ( Baumgartner et al. , 2020 ) as the one used in pre-training the Transformer model , to see whether it was necessary to ensure the model did not stray too far from its ability to handle pure textual input .
See Appendix C for more details .
Fine-tuning Datasets
The goal of our resulting model is to perform well in a multi-modal dialogue setting ; thus , we fine - tune the model on both dialogue and imagedialogue datasets .
For dialogue - based datasets , we consider the same four as in Roller et al . ( 2020 ) : ConvAI2 ( Dinan et al. , 2020 b ) , Empa-theticDialogues ( ED ) ( Rashkin et al. , 2019 ) , Wiz-ard of Wikipedia ( WoW ) ( Dinan et al. , 2019 c ) , and BlendedSkillTalk .
To model image-dialogue , we consider the Image - Chat dataset .
We give a brief description of the five datasets in Appendix B ; more information can be found in Roller et al . ( 2020 ) and .
In the fine-tuning stage , we consider two different regimes : one in which we multi-task train on the five datasets together , and one in which we train on Image - Chat alone .
While the latter regime is useful in exploring upper bounds of model performance , our main goal is to build a model that can display the requisite skills of an appealing conversationalist ( empathy , personalization , knowledge ) while also having the ability to respond to and converse about images ; thus , we are more interested in the former training setup .
See Appendix C for more details .
Experiments
Automatic Evaluations
Results on Pre-Training Datasets
To fully understand the effects of various training data and image features , as well as multi-modal fusion schemes , we measure model perplexity on the COCO and pushshift .
io Reddit validation sets .
We are primarily interested in performance on COCO Captions , as the model has already been extensively pre-trained on the pushshift .
io Reddit data .
The full results are shown in Table 10 in the appendix , and we leave extensive discussion of the results to Appendix D. Notably , we find that training on COCO Captions exclusively yields the best performance on that task , with spatially - based image features yielding better performance than single vector representations .
Additionally , our early fusion scheme outperforms the late fusion scheme holding all other variables constant .
Results on Fine-Tuned Datasets
We conduct the same ablation setups for training on the dialogue and image- and - dialogue datasets as we did in the domain- adapative pre-training setup ; the ablation results for multi-tasking all of the datasets are in Table 11 , while results for finetuning on Image - Chat alone are in Table 12 ( each in the appendix ) .
Results are summarized in Table 1 , and we note some interesting conclusions here , with further details in Appendix E. First , overloading the Trans - Table 2 : Test performance of existing models on the datasets considered , compared to MMB ( specifically , the " MMB Style " model discussed in Section 5.2.1 ) , in terms of F1 , BLEU - 4 ( B ) , and ROUGE -L ( R ) scores .
* indicates that gold knowledge was utilized in the WoW task .
former encoder / decoder to incorporate image features does not hinder performance on dialogue datasets ( as seen via multi-tasked training ) , and in fact domain- adaptive pre-training improves downstream performance on Image - Chat .
In terms of architecture choices , we find that our early fusion architecture improves performance on Image - Chat across all ablation regimes , with Faster R-CNN features yielding the best performance .
Final Test Results
Following the ablation analyses , we decide to compare our best multi-tasked and single - tasked trained model ( with respect to the fine- tuning datasets ) , where we use Faster R-CNN image features and an early fusion scheme , to existing models in the literature .
For this comparison , we consider additional metrics that can be computed on the actual model generations : F1 , BLEU -4 and ROUGE -L .
We generate model responses during inference with the same generation scheme as in Roller et al . ( 2020 ) - beam search with beam size of 10 , minimum beam length of 20 , and tri-gram blocking within the current generation and within the full textual context .
The test perfor-mance of our best multitask model on the various datasets compared to existing models from Section 2.3 is shown in Table 2 , with full test results in Table 13 in Appendix F .
We first note that the Dodeca model performs well across the board , and indeed has the highest ROUGE -L , BLEU -4 , and F1 scores for the three text-only datasets .
Higher BLEU - 4 scores can be attributed to specifying a smaller minimum generation length , as forcing the BlenderBot models to generate no less than 20 tokens hurts precision when compared to reference labels - we verified this by generating with a smaller minimum length ( 5 tokens ) and saw a 20 % increase in BLEU - 4 on Image - Chat for Multi-Modal BlenderBot .
Higher ROUGE -L scores can additionally be attributed to specifying a larger minimum generation length ; this was also verified by generating with a higher minimum length ( 50 tokens ) where we saw nearly a 40 % increase in ROUGE -L score .
Nevertheless , we do not report an exhaustive search over parameters here for our model , and instead compare it to BlenderBot with the same settings next .
When compared to its predecessor , text-only BlenderBot , MMB performs nearly the same on all four text-only datasets , indicating that MMB has not lost its proficiency in text-only dialogue .
Additionally , when comparing performance on Image - Chat to models trained on multi-modal data , MMB outperforms Dodeca in terms of F1 score ( 13.1 vs. 12.9 ) and outperforms 2 AMMC on all three metrics .
For the 2AMMC model , these metrics are computed under the assumption that the model 's chosen response ( from a set of candidate responses collated from the Image - Chat training set ) is the " generated " response .
Human Evaluations
Human / Model Chats Without Images
We compare MMB to BlenderBot by having crowdsourced workers chat with our models , over 50 conversations per model .
( Henceforth we refer to this model as " MMB Style " to reflect the fact that it was exposed to Image - Chat styles during training : see Appendix B for a description of these styles . )
Each conversation consists of 7 turns per speaker , with the human speaking first by saying " Hi ! " , following the convention of Adiwardana et al . ( 2020 ) .
No Image - Chat style is given to MMB Style at the beginning of these conversations , matching its training setup in which no style was given when training on dialogue datasets .
Table 14 shows that human ratings of these conversations , including how often they contain issues such as contradiction and repetitiveness , are similar between models .
We then perform ACUTE - Evals ( Li et al. , 2019 b ) on the collected conversations of MMB Style and BlenderBot in order for crowdsourced raters to directly compare conversations from different models in an A /B setting .
For each comparison , we ask each rater to compare conversations on one of two metrics , following Li et al . ( 2019 b ) : the Preference metric asks , " Who would you prefer to talk to for a long conversation ? " , and the Humanness metric asks , " Which speaker sounds more human ? " .
Results are shown in Table 3 : raters choose conversations from one model over the other roughly equally , with no statistically significant differences among models .
See Appendix G.2 for reasons that raters give for choosing one model over another .
In Table 4 , we also compare MMB Style to two other baseline models , DialoGPT and Meena .
Raters are significantly more likely to prefer MMB Style over both of these models with respect to both the preference and humanness metrics .
Human / Model Chats About Images
We measure MMB Style 's ability to chitchat about what it perceives visually by collecting roughly 50 multi-modal conversations between a human and the MMB Style model , for which each conversation discusses an image taken from the test set of Image - Chat .
2 Image - Chat styles are divided into three categories , " positive " , " neutral " , and " negative " ( Appendix B ) : only Image - Chat images for which the first speaker has a " positive " or " neutral " style are used , and thus images for which the first speaker has a " negative " style are filtered out .
For each conversation , the image is first shown to both the human and the model .
Then , the model responds to the image , and the human responds to the model to carry the conversation forward .
The conversation continues for 6 human utterances and 7 model utterances total .
As a comparison , we also collect similar conversations between humans and two previous models trained on Image - Chat data , Dodeca and 2 AMMC .
Among the three models , 2 AMMC alone is a retrieval model : it retrieves its response from the set of utterances in the Image - Chat training set .
Examples of the three models ' initial responses to an image are in Table 5 .
We then run ACUTE - Evals to ask raters to compare these models ' conversational skills on the Preference , Humanness , and Image - response metrics , where the Image- response metric asks , " Who talks about the image better ? "
The same image is used for both sides of each A /B comparison between conversations .
Ratings are shown in der bias : for instance , there is no safeguard against it misgendering a person in an image , and many common text datasets are known to contain gender bias ( Dinan et al. , 2019a ( Dinan et al. , , 2020a , which may lead to bias in models trained on them .
To remedy this , we train a version of the MMB Style model in which we examine the label of each training example to determine whether it contains female or male words , and then a string representing that classification is appended to the example 's context string ( Dinan et al. , 2019a ) , for input to the model .
At inference time , the string representing a classification of " no female or male words " is appended to the context , nudging the model to generate a response containing no gendered words .
The fraction of utterances produced by this model that still contain gendered words is shown in Table 7 . Compared to the gold response , the original BlenderBot , and MMB Style , this degendered MMB model ( which we call " MMB Degendered " ) reduces the likelihood of producing an utterance with male word ( s ) by roughly a factor of 9 and of producing an utterance with female word ( s ) by roughly a factor of 4 , given a context from the ConvAI2 validation set .
ACUTE - Evals in Table 3 show that this degendering does not lead to a significant drop in the preference for or humanness of the model 's responses during a conversation .
Removing Dependence on Style Since each of the images that MMB Style saw during training was associated with an Image - Chat style , it relies on an input style during inference in order to be able to discuss an image .
However , this results in a model whose utterances will necessarily strongly exhibit a particular style .
( For example , see the " Playful " MMB Style response in Table 21 : constricting the model to respond playfully to all images could seem rather contrived and perhaps unlike typical human speech . )
To avoid this , we train a version of MMB Style where , for 75 % of all images seen during training , the accompanying style is replaced with the string " positive / neutral " or " negative " , depending on which list the style was a part of .
Thus , during inference , the string " positive / neutral " can be used in lieu of a specific style string in order to produce responses that are unlikely to be negative and that do not consistently display strong adherence to a specific style .
We refer to this model as the " MMB Positive " model , or " MMB DegenPos " if it was trained with degendering in addition as in Section 6.1 .
Table 22 in the appendix shows that these models exhibit little increase in perplexity , with the increase likely due to the loss of specificity provided by a concrete style .
The MMB DegenPos model exhibits the same level of degendering as the base MMB Degendered model ( Table 7 ) , and ACUTE - Evals show that these models exhibit no detectable loss of ability to talk about an image ( Table 8 ) .
See Appendix H.1 for an ablation of MMB Positive in which a model is not shown images at all .
Safety
The data contains real-world conversations from the Internet ; and ( 3 ) the Image - Chat dataset has negative styles to better capture the range of human styles .
All of these factors could lead to an unsafe response given a multi-modal context .
To mitigate this problem , we first measure our models ' toxicity using an openly available blocklist 3 and an offensive language classifier presented in .
We define the term " toxicity " to mean the ratio between the number of offensive utterances and the total number of utterances generated by the model .
We evaluate our model on the Image - Chat validation set , with a fixed style trait to control the generation , presenting results for different choices of fixed trait .
We first evaluate our model in the first round of the Image - Chat validation set .
The results in Table 9 indicate that positive styles reduce the level of toxicity by a large margin for both metrics ( classifier and blocklist ) .
The results also align well with our previous experiments on degendering , as toxicity is reduced across all styles after applying the degendering process .
After degendering , we can considerably improve our model 's safety by enforcing that it uses positive styles .
We also evaluate our model in the second round of the conversation and collect the statistics based on the first round style , as shown in Table 23 .
This result suggests that even if the model is controlled with a positive style , it is less safe when responding to negative conversations .
Example
Ethical Considerations
In this work we present conversational agents that maintain dialogue in a multi-modal setting .
Our intention is to ultimately build agents that can meaningfully engage humans in dialogue ; in such a setting , humans who chat with our models would benefit from having a chat partner who is personable , knowledgeable , empathetic , and visually perceptive .
Our experiments and human evaluations lead us to believe that our models are preferred to alternatives , and beneficial interactions should take place when pairing our models with human conversational partners .
It is clear , however , that conversational language can contain offensive statements .
Indeed , if no measures or precautions are taken during model training or deployment , conversational models can produce offensive statements as well - this should come as no surprise given the nature of the pretraining data ( i.e. , Internet chat forums ) ) , yet it is perhaps even more important in a multi-modal setting , where otherwise safe text can be viewed as offensive given the right ( or , in this case , wrong ) visual context .
As we note in our introduction , safety in opendomain dialogue is a well - researched ( and far from solved ) issue , and despite our work not focusing specifically on generating safe conversations , we make some efforts to address safety concerns in Section 6.3 .
As mentioned above , the main goal of this work is to explore and measure the conversational ability of various multi-modal dialogue architectures .
Nevertheless , we acknowledge that safety is a major element of human-model discourse , and we note that we dedicate a substantial portion of the paper towards exploring how certain safety mechanisms impact how humans interact with our models .
In particular , we can identify several potential ethical failure modes that might arise if this model were used in an irresponsible manner .
First , if we were to release this model to the general public as - is without any safety measures in place ( such as the ones we discuss above ) , bad actors could either attempt to find specific dialogues / images for which our model delivers an unsafe response or else deploy this model in a setting that exploits any safety weaknesses in the model .
We also acknowledge the potential for remaining bias in the model 's responses along demographic lines such as gender , although we address the question of gender bias by degendering our model in Section 6.1 .
A Details of Image Encoders
We test the following image encoders in our MMB models : ResNeXt WSL
We first experiment with image representations obtained from pre-training a ResNeXt 32x48d model on nearly 1 billion public images ( Mahajan et al. , 2018 ) , with subsequent fine-tuning on the ImageNet1 K dataset ( Russakovsky et al. , 2015 ) 4 .
The output of this model is a 2048 - dimensional vector , and we refer to these representations as " ResNeXt WSL " features .
ResNeXt WSL Spatial
One can also take the output of the image encoder prior to its final fullyconnected layer to obtain " spatial " image features , resulting in a 2048?7?7 - dimensional vector .
We explore results with these features as well , and refer to them as " ResNeXt WSL Spatial " .
Faster R-CNN
Finally , we consider Faster R-CNN features ( Ren et al. , 2017 ) , using models trained in the Detectron framework ; specifically , we use a ResNeXt - 152 backbone trained on the Visual Genome dataset ( Krishna et al. , 2016 ) with the attribute head ( Singh et al. , 2020a ) 5 . The Faster R-CNN features are 2048?100 - dimensional representations , and we refer to these features as " Faster R -CNN " .
B Dataset Descriptions ConvAI2
The ConvAI2 dataset ( Dinan et al. , 2020 b ) is based on the Persona - Chat ( Zhang et al. , 2018 b ) dataset , and contains 140k training utterances in which crowdworkers were given prepared " persona " lines , e.g . " I like dogs " or " I play basketball " , and then paired up and asked to get to know each other through conversation .
EmpatheticDialogues ( ED )
The EmpatheticDialogues dataset ( Rashkin et al. , 2019 ) was created via crowdworkers as well , and involves two speakers playing different roles in a conversation .
One is a " listener " , who displays empathy in a conversation while conversing with someone who is describing a personal situation .
The model is trained to act like the " listener " .
The resulting dataset contains 50 k utterances .
two speakers discussing a given topic in depth , comprising 194 k utterances .
One speaker ( the " apprentice " ) attempts to dive deep on and learn about a chosen topic ; the other ( the " wizard " ) has access to a retrieval system over Wikipedia , and is tasked with teaching their conversational partner about a topic via grounding their responses in a knowledge source .
BlendedSkillTalk ( BST ) BlendedSkillTalk is a dataset that essentially combines the three above .
That is , crowdworkers are paired up similarly to the three previous datasets , but now all three " skills " ( personalization , empathy , and knowledge ) are at play throughout the dialogue : the speakers are tasked with blending the skills while engaging their partners in conversation .
The resulting dataset contains 74 k utterances .
Image - Chat ( IC )
The Image - Chat dataset contains 200k dialogues over 200k images : crowdworkers were tasked with discussing an image in the context of a given style , e.g. " Happy " , " Cheerful " , or " Sad " , in order to hold an engaging conversation .
The resulting dataset contains over 400k utterances .
For each conversation in the dataset , the two speakers are each assigned a style in which that speaker responds , and these styles are optionally fed into models as part of the input , alongside the dialogue context .
There are 215 styles in total , and styles are divided into 3 categories , " positive " , " neutral " , and " negative " .

C Additional Training Details Domain-adaptive Pre-training During domainadaptive pre-training , we trained the model on 8 GPUs for 10k - 30 k SGD updates , using earlystopping on the validation set .
The models were optimized using Adam ( Kingma and Ba , 2014 ) , with sweeps over a learning rate between 5e - 6 and 3e - 5 , using 100 warmup steps .
Fine-tuning
In this stage , we train the models on 8 GPUs for around 10 k train updates using a similar optimization setup as in the domain- adaptive pretraining stage .
D Automatic Evaluations on Pre-Training Datasets Training Data
We first note that , regardless of image fusion and image feature choices , we see the best performance on COCO Captions by simply fine-tuning exclusively on that data .
This is an expected result , though we do see that in nearly every scenario the decrease in perplexity is not large ( e.g. 5.23 for Faster R-CNN early fusion multi-tasking , down to 4.83 with just COCO Captions ) .
Image Features
Across all training setups , we see that using spatially - based image features ( ResNeXt WSL Spatial , Faster R - CNN ) yields better performance than just a single vector image representation ( ResNeXt WSL ) .
This difference is particularly noticeable when training with COCO and pushshift .
io Reddit , where with Faster R-CNN features the model obtains an average ppl of 9.13 over the two datasets , while with ResNeXt WSL features the model only obtains 10.1 ppl .
We find that using Faster R-CNN features additionally outperforms using ResNeXt WSL Spatial features , where using the latter obtains an average of 10.0 ppl over the two datasets .
Image Fusion Finally , holding all other variables constant , we find that using our early fusion scheme yields improvements over using a late fusion scheme .
E.g. , with Faster-R-CNN features in 6 Lists of positive , neutral , and negative styles are from http://ideonomy.mit.edu/essays/traits.
html , following Shuster et al. ( 2019a ) . the COCO - only setup , we see a decrease in perplexity from 5.21 to 4.83 ; with ResNeXt WSL Spatial image features , we see perplexity differences ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 depending on the training data .

The second- to - last column in ity on Image - Chat compared to 12.92 and 12.87 respectively for single - task training on Image - Chat ( see Table 12 ) .
Image Fusion Finally , we note as before that using our early fusion technique improves performance on Image - Chat across all ablation regimes .
While the average perplexity across the dialogue datasets is best when using late image fusion , we obtain the best image chat perplexity when performing early image fusion .

F Final Test Results
G Additional Human Evaluations Similar human ratings at the end of conversations between a human and a model about an image show that MMB Style beats Dodeca and 2 AMMC on measures of engagingness , humanness , and the ability to talk about an image by a large margin ( Table 15 ) .
G.2 Reasons for ACUTE - Eval Ratings For ACUTE - Evals comparing pairs of human / model conversations from different models , crowdsource workers are asked to select among 10 checkboxes to explain their preference for one conversation over another .
Workers are able to select multiple checkboxes .
Results for ACUTE - Evals on the preference metric are shown in Tables 16 , 17 , and 18 .
G.3 ACUTE - Evals on the models ' first response to an image On ACUTE - Evals comparing two models ' initial responses to the same image , we find that crowdsource raters choose both the MMB Style and 2 AMMC models ' responses significantly more often than those of Dodeca ( Table 19 ) .
We also find no significant difference in the rate at which MMB Style image responses are chosen compared to the same model fine -tuned only on Image - Chat and not on dialogue datasets ( Table 20 ) , which implies that multitasking on dialogue datasets does not degrade the ability to effectively respond to an image .
See Table 21 for additional example responses of models to images .
H Additional Analyses of Safety and Gender Bias See Table 22 for a table of perplexies of all MMB model variants .
Table 23 displays measurements of safety in the second rounds of Image - Chat conversations dependent on whether first round exhibited a positive or negative style .
H.1 Analyzing Dependence on Image
We also train a no-image ablation model , otherwise equivalent to MMB Positive , for which Image - Chat images are removed during both training and inference : crowdsource workers prefer the image responses of MMB Positive to those of this ablation model 80 % to 20 % ( Table 24 ) .
For this ablation , style was removed from the context ( replaced with the string " positive / neutral " ) to prevent the ablation model from being aided by this information .
I Example Conversations and Failure Modes Figure 1 in particular demonstrates a successful conversation : the model is clearly able to interpret what is in the image ( a teddy bear and a road ) , and it is able to thoughtfully and creatively combine these two subjects in the conversation for several turns .
Figure 2 provides several more example conversations : in all of these , the model is able to both discuss the image and use it as a catalyst for further conversation , although occasionally with contradiction and forgetfulness issues as seen in Roller et al . ( 2020 ) .
( For instance , the model contradicts itself on whether it has any pets and forgets who is planning to make a fancy dinner . )
Last , we show a few hand -picked examples of poor conversations in Figure 3 : in these , the model fails to identify the contents of the images , identifying them both as buildings , although this may reflect a difference in the prevalence of ( for example ) buildings vs. roller coasters in the training sets .
Despite the human nudging the model about what the images actually convey , the model does not demonstrate that it has corrected its initial misidentification in later turns .
This could perhaps be remedied by an increase in image training data , by further advancements in the integration of image features with this BlenderBot - based sequence - to- sequence model , or perhaps by training specifically on data in which one partner learns about the contents of an image over time .

7 Conclusion
In this work , we explored a necessary component of open-domain dialogue models preferred by hu- mans : the ability to perceive and converse in the context of what is seen .
We showed that we can match prior work in text -only dialogue in both auto- mated metrics and preference / humanness metrics , and our best model surpasses existing models in multi-modal dialogue .
Finally , we demonstrated that we do not sacrifice human preference for our model by incorporating safety components into it .
We show several handpicked examples of conversa- tions with our MMB DegenPos model in Figures 1 ,
