Thinking Clearly , Talking Fast : Concept - Guided Non-Autoregressive Generation for Open-Domain Dialogue Systems
abstract
Human dialogue contains evolving concepts , and speakers naturally associate multiple concepts to compose a response .
However , current dialogue models with the seq2seq framework lack the ability to effectively manage concept transitions and can hardly introduce multiple concepts to responses in a sequential decoding manner .
To facilitate a controllable and coherent dialogue , in this work , we devise a conceptguided non-autoregressive model ( CG - nAR ) for open-domain dialogue generation .
The proposed model comprises a multi-concept planning module that learns to identify multiple associated concepts from a concept graph and a customized Insertion Transformer that performs concept-guided non-autoregressive generation to complete a response .
The experimental results on two public datasets show that CG - nAR can produce diverse and coherent responses , outperforming state - of - the - art baselines in both automatic and human evaluations with substantially faster inference speed .
Introduction Creating a " human-like " dialogue system is one of the important goals of artificial intelligence .
Recently , due to the rapid advancements in natural language generation ( NLG ) techniques , datadriven approaches have attracted lots of research interest and have achieved impressive progress in producing fluent dialogue responses ( Shang et al. , 2015 ; Vinyals and Le , 2015 ; Serban et al. , 2016 ; Li et al. , 2016 ) .
However , such seq2seq models tend to degenerate generic or off-topic responses ( Tang et al. , 2019 ; Welleck et al. , 2020 ) .
An effective way to address this issue is to leverage external knowledge ( Zhou et al. , 2018 a , b ) or topic information ( Xing et al. , 2017 ) , which are integrated as additional semantic representations to improve dialogue informativeness .
Although promising results have been obtained by equipping dialogue models with external knowl - edge , the development of dialogue discourse still has its own challenge : human dialogue generally evolves around a number of concepts that might frequently shift in a dialogue flow .
The lack of concept management strategies might lead to incoherent dialogue due to the loosely connected concepts .
To address this problem , recent studies have combined concept planning with response generation to form a more coherent and controllable dialogue Xu et al. , 2020a , b ; . Most of these approaches incorporate concepts into responses in an implicit manner , which cannot guarantee the appearance of a concept in a response .
Compared with dialogue concepts , a large proportion of chit-chat words are common and usually have a high word frequency and are relatively overoptimized in language models ( Gong et al. , 2018 ; Khassanov et al. , 2019 ) .
Consequently , conventional seq2seq generators are more " familiar " with these generic words than those requiring concept management , which prevents introducing certain concepts to the response with sequential decoding ( either greedily or with beam search ) ( Mou et al. , 2016 ) .
Moreover , speakers naturally associate multiple concepts to proactively convey diverse information , e.g. , action , entity , and emotion ( see Figure 1 ) .
Unfortunately , most existing methods can only retrieve one concept for each utterance ( Tang et al. , 2019 ; Qin et al. , 2020 ) .
Another line of approaches attempt to explicitly integrate concepts into responses and generate the remaining words in both directions ( Mou et al. , 2016 ; Xu et al. , 2020a ) , but they also fail to deal with multiple concepts .
In this paper , we devise a concept-guided nonautoregressive model ( CG - nAR ) to facilitate dialogue coherence by explicitly introducing multiple concepts into dialogue responses .
Specifically , following Xu et al . ( 2020a ) , a concept graph is constructed based on the dialogue data , where the vertices represent concepts , and edges represent concept transitions between utterances .
Based on the concept graph , we introduce a novel multiconcept planning module that learns to manage concept transitions in a dialogue flow .
It recurrently reads historical concepts and dialogue context to attentively select multiple concepts in the proper order , which reflects the transition and arrangement of target concepts .
Then , we customize an Insertion Transformer ( Stern et al. , 2019 ) by initializing the selected concepts as a partial response for subsequent non-autoregressive generation .
The remaining words of a response are generated in parallel , aiming to foster a fast and controllable decoding process .
We conducted experiments on Persona - Chat ( Zhang et al. , 2018 ) and Weibo ( Shang et al. , 2015 ) .
The results of automatic and human evaluations show that CG - nAR achieves better performance in terms of response diversity and dialogue coherence .
We also show that the inference time of our model is much faster than conventional seq2seq models .
All our codes and datasets are publicly available .
1 Our contributions to the field are three - fold : 1 ) We design a concept-guided non-autoregressive strategy that can successfully integrate multiple concepts into responses for a controllable decoding process .
2 ) The proposed multi-concept planning module effectively manages multi-concept transitions and remedies the problem of dialogue incoherence .
3 ) Comprehensive studies on two datasets show the effectiveness of our method in terms of response quality and decoding efficiency .
Related Work
Open-Domain Dialogue Generation Neural seq2seq models ( Sutskever et al. , 2014 ) have achieved remarkable success in dialogue 1 https://github.com/RowitZou/CG-nAR systems ( Shang et al. , 2015 ; Vinyals and Le , 2015 ; Serban et al. , 2016 ; Xing et al. , 2017 ) , but they prefer to produce generic and off-topic responses ( Tang et al. , 2019 ; Welleck et al. , 2020 ) .
Dozens of works have attempted to incorporate external knowledge into dialogue systems to improve informativeness and diversity ( Zhou et al. , 2018a ; Zhang et al. , 2018 ; Dinan et al. , 2019 ; Ren et al. , 2020 ) .
Beyond the progress on response quality , a couple of works focus on goal planning or concept transition for a controllable and coherent dialogue ( Yao et al. , 2018 ; Moon et al. , 2019 ; Xu et al. , 2020a , b ; . Most of these works mainly explore how to effectively leverage external knowledge graphs and extract concepts from them .
Nevertheless , they generally introduce concepts into the response implicitly with gated controlling or copy mechanism , which cannot ensure the success of concept integration because seq2seq models prefer generic words .
Some works ( Mou et al. , 2016 ; Xu et al. , 2020a ) try to produce concept words first and generate the remaining words to both directions to complete a response , but they cannot handle the situation of multiple concepts .
By contrast , we focus on how to effectively integrate multiple extracted concepts into dialogue responses .
The proposed CG - nAR applies the nonautoregressive mechanism , which can explicitly introduce multiple concepts simultaneously to responses to enhance coherence and diversity .
Non-Autoregressive Generation Compared with traditional sequential generators that conditions each output word on previously generated outputs , non-autoregressive ( non - AR ) generation avoids this property to speed up decoding efficiency and has recently attracted much attention ( Gu et al. , 2018 ( Gu et al. , , 2019 Ma et al. , 2019 ; Stern et al. , 2019 ) .
Another relevant line of research is refinement - based generation ( Lee et al. , 2018 ; Kasai et al. , 2020 ; Hua and Wang , 2020 ; Tan et al. , 2021 ) , which gradually improves generation quality by iterative refinement on the draft instead of one - pass generation .
For dialogue systems , there has been prior works that attempt to improve the traditional autoregressive generation .
Mou et al . ( 2016 ) explores the way of generating words to both directions , but it is still in an autoregressive manner .
Song et al. ( 2020 )
Initialize Step 0 : Step 1 : Step 2 : Step 3 : ( a) Multi-Concept Planning ( b) Concept - Guided Non-AR Generation consistency of dialogue generation , but it requires a specialized consistency matching model for inference .
Han et al. ( 2020 ) applies the non -AR mechanism to dialogue generation , aiming to alleviate the non-globally - optimal issue to produce a more diverse response .
In this work , we further use dialogue concepts to guide response generation .
We customize an Insertion Transformer ( Stern et al. , 2019 ) and arrange dialogue concepts as a partial input sequence , which is different from the original setting where texts are generated from scratch .
By this means , multiple concepts can be naturally introduced to the response as a guidance to foster a more controllable non -AR generation .
Methodology
The overall framework of CG - nAR is shown in Figure 2 . Based on a concept graph that represents candidate concept transitions , a multi-concept planning module is designed to select and arrange appropriate target concepts from the contextually related subgraphs , which is conditioned on the previous concept flow and the dialogue context .
Then , we input the selected concepts as a partial response into an Insertion Transformer ( Stern et al. , 2019 ) to parallelly generate the remaining words .
Concept Graph Construction Inspired by Xu et al . ( 2020a ) , we build a concept graph with two steps : vertex construction 2 and 2
The original constructed vertices in Xu et al . ( 2020a ) involve what -vertices and how-vertices , where how-vertices represent different ways of expressing response content with a multi-mapping model ( Chen et al. , 2019 ) .
Here , we only collect what -vertices as dialogue concepts .
edge construction .
Given a dialogue corpus S , we exploit a rule-based keyword extraction method to identify salient keywords from utterances in S ( Tang et al. , 2019 ) .
All extracted keywords are collected as dialogue concepts that represent vertices in the concept graph .
For edge construction , we use pointwise mutual information ( PMI ) ( Church and Hanks , 1989 ) to construct a concept pairwise matrix that characterizes the association between concepts in the observed dialogue data ( Mou et al. , 2016 ; Tang et al. , 2019 ) , where each concept pair consists of two concepts that are extracted from the context and the response , respectively .
For each head vertex v h , we select concepts with top PMI scores as tail vertices v t and build edges by connecting v h with all v t s .
In this way , we filter out low-frequency edges to narrow the search space for downstream concept planning .
Multi-Concept Planning Module Given the dialogue context D , the historical concept flow F , and a concept graph G , the goal of multi-concept planning is to predict a sequence of target concepts C , namely P ( C|D , F , G ) .
All target concepts are extracted from G and arranged in a sequence C = {c 1 , c 2 , ... , c t } , which reflects the order of target concepts in the final response .
Hierarchical Dialogue Encoder .
To facilitate the understanding of dialogue context D , we employ Transformer blocks ( Vaswani et al. , 2017 ) to hierarchically encode dialogue context , aiming to capture the global semantic dependency between utterances .
Formally , given the dialogue context D = {u 1 , u 2 , ... , u N } with N utterances , where u i = {w i1 , w i2 , ... , w in } is the word sequence of i-th utterance , we transform u i into a sequence of hidden vectors with a Transformer encoder : [ ?cls i , ? i1 , ... , ? in ] = TF ?w ( [ e cls i , e w i1 , ... , e w in ] ) .
( 1 ) Here , e w ij is the embedding of the j-th word in u i .
? cls i and e cls i represent a special token [ CLS ] that is used to aggregate sequence representations , which is inspired by Devlin et al . ( 2019 ) .
Then , we collect utterance representations derived from [ CLS ] and input them into another Transformer encoder to hierarchically fuse context information : [ h cls 1 , h cls 2 , ... , h cls N ] = TF ?u ( [ ?cls 1 , ?cls 2 , ... , ?cls N ] ) . ( 2 ) h cls i is a context - aware utterance representation that can be used to guide concept selection in the following steps .
Concept Flow Encoder .
Formally , a concept flow F = {f 1 , f 2 , ... , f N } represents the observed concepts in the dialogue context , where f i means a concept set corresponding to the i-th utterance that collects all the concept words in u i , namely f i = { c i1 , c i2 , ...c im }.
Here , c ij is the j-th concept word in u i .
For an empty set f i = ? , a special NULL token is served as the concept word .
To capture information of history concept transitions , we exploit a vanilla GRU unit ( Cho et al. , 2014 ) to recursively read concept words in the flow : s i = GRU ( s i?1 , f i ) , i ? [ 1 , N ] . ( 3 )
Here f i denotes the representation of concept set f i , which is calculated as a weighted sum of concept word embeddings e c ij : f i = m j=1 ? f ij e c ij , ? f ij = exp (?
f ij ) m k=1 exp (? f ik ) , ( 4 ) ? f ij = s i?1 W f e c ij , where W f is trainable parameters .
The output state s i?1 at the i ?
1 step is used as a query to compute ?
f ij scores , which can measure the preference of transitions to associated concepts .
Empirically , s 0 is a zero vector to initialize the recurrent process , and the final output s N can serve as a memory to enable history - aware concept planning .
Multi-Concept Extractor .
Recall that our goal is to produce a concept sequence C , which is a subsequence of the target response .
Inspired by pointer network , we design a multi-concept extractor to achieve this goal , which can attentively read the dialogue context and the concept flow to sequentially extract target concepts from the contextually related subgraphs in G .
To implement concept extraction in a sequential decoding manner , we use a Transformer decoder and compute its decoding states as follows : H cls = [ h cls 1 , h cls 2 , ... , h cls N ] , m t = TF ? d ( [ e c 1:t?1 ] , H cls ) .
( 5 ) The utterance representations H cls are memories for decoder-encoder attention . [ e c 1:t?1 ] denotes the embeddings of previously decoded concepts .
m t is the output state at step t conditioned on the dialogue context and partially decoded outputs .
Given the decoder state m t and the concept flow memory s N , the following step is to select target concepts from G .
We first retrieve a group of subgraphs that corresponds to the concept set f N of the last utterance u N to prepare for the next round of concept transition .
Here , each subgraph g j consists of a hit concept c N j ? f N and its concept neighbours .
Formally , g j = { ( c head j , c tail jk ) }
Ng j k=1 , where c head j and c tail jk represent head concept vertex and tail concept vertex , respectively .
N g j means the number of vertex pairs in g j .
Then , we employ a dynamic graph attention mechanism to calculate subgraph vectors g j at each decoding step t to fuse information of all concept neighbours : g j = Ng j k=1 ? g jk [ e head j ; e tail jk ] , ? g jk = exp (? g jk ) Ng j l=1 exp ( ? g jl ) , ( 6 ) ? g jk = ( W g q [ m t ; s N ; e head j ] ) ?
( W g k e tail jk ) .
W g q , W g k are trainable parameters .
e head j , e tail jk are embeddings of head and tail concepts in g j .
Here , ? g jk is the probability of choosing c tail jk from all concept neighbours in g j at step t conditioned on the dialogue context and the concept flow .
We then compute the probability of choosing g j at step t as a top-level concept selection , denoted as ?
t j : ? t j = exp (?
t j ) m l=1 exp (?
t l ) , ? t j = ( W t q [ m t ; s N ] ) ?
( W t k g j ) , ( 7 ) where W t q and W t k are trainable parameters .
Finally , the selection probability of target concepts at step t can be derived as : P ( c t |c 1:t?1 , D , F , G ) = ? t j ? g jk . ( 8 )
The multi-concept extractor has two stop conditions : 1 ) We add a special token c stop to the concept neighbour set of g j 3 .
The extractor treats c stop as a legal candidate target , and the selection of c stop results in a stop action .
2 ) the number of target concepts exceeds N max .
Furthermore , for all the concepts extracted at step k( k < t ) , we set their probabilities to 0 to avoid duplicate extraction .
Concept - Guided Insertion Transformer
After obtaining the target concept sequence C , the next step is to generate a response that covers C. General autoregressive approaches cannot ensure the success of introducing certain contents because they prefer to generate generic words ( Mou et al. , 2016 ) .
Given a substantially big language model , the problem might be alleviated but still cannot be completely solved .
To address the issue , we use an Insertion Transformer ( Stern et al. , 2019 ) to generate a response based on C , which ensures the appearance of target concepts .
On the other hand , the explicit planned concepts can be regarded as a prompt or a signal to guide the generation process .
Generation is accomplished by repeatedly making insertions into a sequence initialized by C until a termination condition is met .
At each decoding step t , the Insertion Transformer produces a joint distribution over the choice of words w t and all available insertion locations l t ? [ 0 , |? t?1 | ] in the previously decoded response ?t?1 : ?0 = C , ?t = [ e w k | w k ? ?t ] , ( 9 ) p( w t , l t | D , ?t?1 ) = InsTF ( H cls , ?t?1 ) , where ?t is the word embedding list of ?t . Notably , ?t has multiple available insertion locations , and we can perform parallel decoding by applying insertions at multiple locations simultaneously .
For more details of Insertion Transformer , please refer to Stern et al . ( 2019 ) due to the space limitation .
3
In this case , we make sure that Ng j > 0 , where gj has at least one special vertex pair ( c head j , c stop ) .
Training and Loss Functions
Given the list of ground truth concepts C in the target response y , the concept extractor is trained as a usual sequence generation model to minimize the negative log likelihood ( NLL ) loss as follows : L C = 1 | C | | C | t=1 ?logp ( c t |c 1:t?1 , D , F , G ) . ( 10 )
To train the Insertion Transformer , we first sample a subsequence ?
containing all the target concepts from the target response y .
Then , for each of the k + 1 locations l = 0 , 1 , ... , k in ? , let ( w i l , w i l + 1 , ... , w j l ) be the span of words from the target response yet to be produced at location l .
The loss function is finally defined as follows : L R = 1 k + 1 k l=0 j l i=i l ?logp ( w i , l|D , ? ) ? w l ( i ) .
( 11 ) Here w l ( i ) is a softmax weighting policy ( Stern et al. , 2019 ) that performs a weighted sum of the negative log-likelihoods of the words in the span .
It encourages the generator to produce the central words of the span for a faster decoding process .
Experimental Settings
Datasets Experiments are conducted on two public opendomain dialogue datasets Persona - Chat ( Zhang et al. , 2018 ) and Weibo ( Shang et al. , 2015 ) . For Persona - Chat , the associated persona information is discarded so that the model can focus on the development of dialogues .
Following previous works ( Tang et al. , 2019 ; Xu et al. , 2020a ) , we employ a rule-based method to automatically extract concept words of each utterance , which combines tf -idf and POS features for scoring word salience .
After dataset cleaning , we re-split the Persona - Chat dataset into train / valid / test sets as done in Tang et al . ( 2019 ) random .
After constructing the graph of Persona - Chat , we randomly sample 100 concept vertices and 200 edges and ask three human annotators to evaluate their appropriateness .
About 93 % vertices and 72 % edges are accepted by the annotators .
For the graph of Weibo , we use the graph released by Xu et al . ( 2020a ) .
Statistics of the two dialogue datasets along with the constructed graphs is shown in Table 1 .
Comparison Methods
We compare CG - nAR with two groups of baselines : general seq2seq models and concept-guided systems .
General seq2seq models produce responses conditioned on the dialogue messages without concept planning , including : Seq2seq + Att ( Sutskever et al. , 2014 ) , a standard RNN model with attention mechanism ; Transformer ( Vaswani et al. , 2017 )
Implementation Details
We used VGAE ( Kipf and Welling , 2016 ) to initialize the representation of concept vertices in the concept graph , and used Word2Vec ( Mikolov et al. , 2013 ) to initialize word embeddings .
The embedding size of vertices and words was set to 128 and 300 , respectively .
We employed Adam ( Kingma and Ba , 2015 ) with learning rate 1e - 3 to train the concept extractor and the Insertion Transformer .
All Transformer blocks have 3 layers , 768 hidden units , 8 heads , and the hidden size for all feed -forward layers is 2,048 .
The hidden size of GRU cells is 768 .
At inference time , the multiconcept extractor produces concepts greedily , and the maximum number of allowed concepts N max was set to 5 .
For the Insertion Transformer , we used the configuration that achieved the best results reported in Stern et al . ( 2019 ) .
The whole model was trained for 100,000 steps with 8,000 warm - up steps on a 3090 GPU .
Checkpoints were saved and evaluated on the validation set every 2,000 steps .
Checkpoints with the top performance were finally evaluated on the test set to report final results .
5 Results and Analysis
Automatic Evaluation
We adopt widely used BLEU ( Papineni et al. , 2002 ) and ROUGE ( Lin , 2004 ) to measure the relevance between the generation and the ground-truth .
We report averaged BLEU scores with 4 - grams at most and ROUGE - 1/L ( RG - 1/L ) F-scores .
To measure the diversity of generated responses , we report the ratio of distinct uni / bi-grams ( Dist - 1/2 ) in all generated responses ( Li et al. , 2016 ) .
Table 2 shows the results of automatic evaluation for CG - nAR and baseline methods .
All methods can be categorized into two groups : traditional seq2seq based generators and concept grounded methods .
CG - nAR outperforms all other baselines significantly on BLEU and ROUGE scores ( using Wilcoxon signed - rank test , p< 0.05 ) , which manifests that the responses generated by CG - nAR match better with the ground -truth responses .
This means CG - nAR can maintain the dialogue flow on -topic by the multi-concept planning mechanism .
In terms of Dist - 1/ 2 that measures the response diversity , all methods with concept planning can produce more diverse responses than those without , which indicates the problem of generic responses is alleviated by integrating concept information .
Compared to the baselines with concept planning , CG - nAR has a better performance on response diversity .
It verifies the effectiveness of our multiconcept planning module and the concept- guided non-autoregressive strategy , which can produce and combine multiple context-related concepts to compose diverse responses and keep concept words in the output response in an explicit manner .
Manual Evaluation
Considering automatic metrics may not suitably reflect the content to be evaluated , we further performed manual evaluation following previous works ( Zhou et al. , 2018a ; .
Specifically , we randomly sampled 200 testing pairs from each test set and employed three annotators with professional background knowledge to evaluate the responses .
Given a dialogue message , annotators were required to conduct pair-wise comparison between the response generated by CG - nAR and the one by a baseline ( 1,600 comparisons with four baselines on two datasets in total ) .
For each comparison , annotators decided which response is better in terms of appropriateness ( the model 's ability to produce a fluent , coherent , and context- relevant response ) and informativeness ( if the response provides diverse information ) .
For appropriateness , the percentage of pairs that at least 2 annotators gave the same judge ( 2/3 agreement ) is 95.8 % , and the percentage for 3/3 agreement is 62.7 % .
For informativeness , the at least 2/3 agreement is 89.0 % and 3/3 agreement is 56.2 % .
We compare CG - nAR against four baselines on Persona - Chat and Weibo ( see Table 3 ) .
The score represents the percentage of times CG - nAR is chosen as the better in pair-wise comparisons .
For appropriateness , CG - nAR significantly outperforms all other baselines on two datasets ( using sign test , p < 0.05 ) .
It means that CG - nAR can generate more context-relevant and coherent responses accepted by annotators , which validates the effectiveness of our multi-concept planning module .
In terms of informativeness , the percentages that CG - nAR wins ReCoSa are noticeably higher than those against other baselines .
It indicates that systems with a concept planning mechanism can produce more informative responses by content introducing .
Analysis of Multi-Concept Planning
To validate if the multi-concept planning module has the ability to extract context-relevant concepts and form a coherent dialogue , we calculate the precision , recall , and F1 score of predicted concepts against golden ones in responses ( Concept - P /R / F1 ) .
We also record the average number of predicted concepts to measure the model 's ability to introduce multiple concepts .
From Table 4 we can observe that CG - nAR achieves a higher recall and F1 score against all baselines by a large margin , especially for ReCoSa and Seq2BF .
It probes that our concept planning module can successfully extract more concepts relevant to the dialogue .
This is also reflected in the number of predicted concepts , where CG - nAR produces more concept words than those methods with autoregressive generators , e.g. , CCM and ConceptFlow .
It indicates that the concept-guided generator can effectively keep the concept information in output responses using a non-autoregressive generation mechanism .
Ablation Study
We perform ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each part of CG - nAR .
Table 5 shows the results .
One of the variants is a vanilla Insertion Transformer where the concept planning module is removed .
The model performance unsurprisingly degrades by a large margin , because the model might produce generic responses without concept planning .
After removing the concept flow encoder , the information of historical concept transitions is missing , which also leads to a performance drop .
We further replace the hierarchical dialogue encoder with a vanilla Transformer encoder , the performance drop shown in Table 5 indicates that it is necessary to capture the context dependency information when performing dialogue modeling .
To probe the effectiveness of the concept-guided non-autoregressive strategy , we replace the Insertion Transformer with a universal Transformer framework equipped with a gated controller as done in , where the generation probabilities are calculated over the word vocabulary and the set of selected concept words .
Table 5 shows that with the autoregressive decoding strategy , the performance drop is significant .
A possible explanation is that the appearance of some key concepts cannot be guaranteed by such an implicit concept-oriented generator , especially when the generator encounters concepts that are not frequently seen in the training set .
Speed Comparison
Our concept-guided non-autoregressive generation model shows not only the superiority on response quality , but also gives a significant speed - up at test time over the methods equipped with autoregressive generators .
The results of speed comparison is shown in Table 6 .
For a fair comparison , we choose the baselines with a Transformer encoderdecoder framework , since our customized Insertion Transformer uses the same model components .
The main advantage of the insertion - based generator at inference time is that we can predict words at different insertion locations simultaneously .
From Table 6 we can see that CG - nAR achieves substantially test-time speed - up compared to the two autoregressive generators ( up to 2.7x in total time and 1.6x in word generation rate ) even when CG - nAR has more parameters 5 .
Case Study
To compare different models intuitively , we show two dialogue cases of the Persona - Chat dataset with output responses in Table 7 .
We observe that CG - nAR can successfully output contextassociated concepts , e.g. , grow vegetable that is related to garden , and singer that is related to country music .
Compared to other baselines , CG - nAR produces a response that is more coherent and relevant to the dialogue context , and shows a more I like going shopping and watching tv .

Table 6 : 6 Inference speed on the Persona - Chat test set .
Param .
denotes the number of parameters .
The original CCM uses an external knowledge graph .
Here we adapt it to our constructed concept graph for a fair comparison .
The same strategy is applied to ConceptFlow .
Here we test the autoregressive baselines with a beam size of 3 ( used for their best scores ) .
Without beam-search , they have significantly worse results , so we do not compare speed -ups with that version .
