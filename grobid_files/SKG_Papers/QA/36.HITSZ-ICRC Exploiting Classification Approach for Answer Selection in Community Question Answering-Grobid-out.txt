HITSZ-ICRC: Exploiting Classification Approach for Answer Selection in Community Question Answering

abstract
This paper describes the participation of the HITSZ-ICRC team on the Answer Selection Challenge in SemEval-2015. Our team participated in English subtask A, English subtask B and Arabic task. Two approaches, ensemble learning and hierarchical classification were proposed for answer selection in each task. Bag-of-words features, lexical features and non-textual features were employed. For the Arabic task, features were extracted from both Arabic data and English data that translated from the Arabic data. Evaluation demonstrated that the proposed methods were effective, achieving a macro-averaged F1 of 56.41% (rank 2 nd ) in English subtask A, 53.60 % (rank 3 rd ) in English subtask B and 67.70% (rank 3 rd ) in Arabic task, respectively.

Introduction In recent years, community question answering (CQA) systems are becoming more and more popular on the Internet. By using CQA system, a user can post his/her question on CQA portal and receive answers from other users. All users can post questions and answers on CQA portal freely. Although it makes CQA users to get answers easily, the answer quality evaluation becomes a challenge for questions with multiple answers. To reduce the inconvenient in going through plenty of candidate answers, it makes sense to evaluate the quality of answers and select high-quality answers automatically for CQA systems. As a consequently, the task of answer quality evaluation and answer selection in CQA have attracted more and more attention in recent years  (Arai and Handayani, 2013; Shah and Pomerantz, 2010; Agichtein et al., 2008) . The Answer Selection in CQA challenge was opened as one new task in SemEval-2015: SemEval-2015 Task 3  (M?rquez et al., 2015) . It created a venue and provided annotated datasets for researchers to compare their methods for answer selection in CQA. This challenge consisted of Subtask A and Subtask B. Subtask A required participant system to classify answers as relevant, potentially useful and bad for each question. Subtask B required participant system to decide whether the answer to a YES_NO question should be Yes, No or Unsure based on the answer list. Subtask A was offered for two languages: English and Arabic. Data for the two languages was in different data set format. In remainder of this paper, Subtask A in English is abbreviated to English subtask A, Subtask A in Arabic is abbreviated to Arabic task and Subtask B in English is abbreviated to English subtask B. HITSZ-ICRC team participated in English subtask A, English subtask B and Arabic task. This paper describes the ensemble learning method and hierarchical classification method proposed for each subtask in SemEval-2015 Task 3. 

 Methods for Answer Classification Different classification methods were tried by previous researchers for answer evaluation, prediction and selection in CQA.  Jeon et al. (2006)  designed a framework using non-textual features, most of which were user profile features, to predict the document quality and tried the framework on CQA.  Shah and Pomerantz (2010)  used text, user information and answer rank features to evaluate and predict answer quality.  Arai and Handayani (2013)  tried non-textual features mainly include nocontent features of text to train models to predict answer quality in CQA. For SemEval-2015 Task 3, we proposed ensemble learning method and hierarchical classification method to classify answers for each task. 

 English subtask A English subtask A required participant system to classify each answer of test questions as definitely relevant (good), potentially useful (potential) or bad  (bad, dialog, non-English and other) . Features employed to train classifiers for English subtask A include: Word length features: length of the max length word, average word length. Word number features: word number, capital word number, polite word number, word "yes" number, word "no" number, word "thank" number. Punctuation features: question mark number, exclamation mark number. Sentence features: average sentence length, sentence number. Part-of-speech features: noun word number and ratio, verb word number and ratio, pronoun word number and ratio, WH word number and ratio. Name entity feature: number of name entity. Content tag features: number of web link and number of image link contained in content. The 7 groups features in the upper list were extracted separately on questions and answers. Answer position in Answer list: whether the answer is first, whether the answer is last. User id features: whether user id of answer is the question user id, whether the user id of previous answer is question user id, whether the user id of next answer is question user id. Answer and question correlative features: number and ratio of same n-gram terms between answer and question, cosine similarity between answer body and question body, KL distance between answer body and question body. Class tag features: QCATEGORY tag of question, QTYPE tag of question. Frequent n-gram term features: frequent unigram terms, bigram terms and trigram terms.  

 English subtask B The English subtask B required participant system to give "Yes", "No" or "Unsure" answer directly to a YES_NO question based on its candidate answers. Evidence to answer YES_NO question is the yes/no opinion of each good answer in answer list. YES_NO question answering can be split into three steps: first, finding out good answers from candidate answers; second, classifying each good answer into yes, no or unsure based on its opinion; third, summarizing final answer for YES_NO question according to opinions of all good answers. Given a YES_NO question, recognizing good answers can be achieved with the classifiers trained in English subtask A; final answer is predicted based on the comparison between the number of yes class answers and the number of no class answers in answer list of the question. So the remaining task for YES_NO question answering is good answer classification according to the opinion. Two methods were proposed for answer opinion classification: (1) piping the best performance classifier for answer selection and the best classifier for answer opinion classification; (2) classifying answers of YES_NO question into 5 classes with single classifier: yes, no, unsure, bad and dialogue. Feature extraction for English subtask A was same as English subtask A. Features employed were selected according to gain ratio. We proposed ensemble learning method for the answer classification in English subtask B. 

 Arabic task Dataset for Arabic task is in Arabic. The task required participant system to classify answers of question into definitely relevant (direct), potentially useful (related) and bad (irrelevant). Features extracted for Arabic task are similar to English subtask A. But some features were not extracted for Arabic task, such as "answer position" was ineffective for Arabic task; "WH word number" cannot be extracted on Arabic data. To get more effective features, the dataset for Arabic task was translated to English by Google Translate 1 , and feature extraction was done on both original Arabic data and English data translated from original Arabic data. Features extracted for answer classification in Arabic task include: Word length features: length of the max length word, average word length. Word number feature: number of words. Punctuation features: question mark number, exclamation mark number. Sentence features: average sentence length, sentence number. The features in the upper list were extracted separately on answers and questions. Answer and question correlative features: number and ratio of same n-gram terms, cosine similarity between answer and question body, KL distance between answer and question body. Name entity feature: number of name entity in answer. Frequent n-gram term features: frequent unigram, bigram terms and trigram terms in Arabic data and English data. Features were extracted only on translated English data in the following 2 groups: Word number features in English: all capital word number, polite word number, word "yes" number, word "no" number. Part-of-speech features: noun word number and ratio, verb word number and ratio, pronoun word number and ratio, WH word number and ratio. Methods proposed for Arabic task include: (1) two-level hierarchical classification method: classifying answers as irrelevant and not irrelevant in the first level and classifying not irrelevant answers as direct and related in the second level; (2) ensemble learning method: training and choosing top N best classifiers and using the results of those classifiers to vote final result. For English task, CQA-QL corpus  (M?rquez et al., 2015)  was provided. This corpus was gotten from the Qatar Living Forum 2 and was filtered and annotated manually. Questions in the corpus were labeled into GENERAL and YES_NO class in QTYPE dimension, and yes, no, unsure and Not Applicable class in QGOLD_YN dimension. Answers were labeled into Good, Potential, Bad, Dialogue, Not English and Other class in CGOLD dimension, and Yes, No, Unsure and Not Applicable class in CGOLD_YN dimension. 

 Data Sets For Arabic task, Fatwa corpus  (M?rquez et al., 2015)  was provided, which was manually processed and annotated on source data from the Fatwa website 3 . Answers in this corpus were labeled into direct, related, and irrelevant class. The irrelevant class answers for each question were random selected from answers of other questions. 

 Results Evaluation Some toolkits were employed to extract features and train classifiers. NLTK  (Bird et al., 2009)  was used to extract features, include part-of-speech of question and answer, frequent n-gram terms, cosine similarity and so on. WEKA  (Hall et al., 2009)  toolkit was used to do feature selection and classifier training and choosing. LIBSVM  (Chang and Lin, 2011)  and LIBLINEAR  (Fan et al., 2008)  were used to train SVM classifier. Scikit-learn toolkit  (Pedregosa et al., 2011)  was used to train classifiers. We submitted 3 formal results for each subtask including English subtask A, English subtask B and Arabic task following task result submission requests: 1 primary result as team official result, 2 contrastive results to compare effects of different methods. 

 Measures The official metric to evaluate results is the macroaveraged F1-score  (M?rquez et al., 2015) , which is calculated as: 1 1 1 NumC i i F macro F NumC ? ? ? ? (1) where NumC is the number of class in test set, F1 i is the F1 value for class i in test set. F1 value is calculated as: 2 1 P R F P R ? ? ? ? (2) where P and R is the precision and recall of test results for a class in test set. The total accuracy for test result is used as secondary metric for results comparison, which is calculated as: totalRighNum Accuracy totalTestCaseNum ? (3) 

 Results of English subtask A Official evaluation on English subtask A was different to other task. In CQA-QL corpus, all answers were labeled in fine-grained labels which include 6 classes: good, bad, potential, dialogue, "not English" and other. But in official evaluation, the macro-F1 score was calculated based on the coarse-grained labels which include 3 classes: good, bad, potential. The class dialogue, "not English" and other were merged with class bad. We considered English subtask A as a 5-class (good, potential, bad, dialogue, and "not English") classification problem. The answers in "not English" class were firstly recognized by toolkit Language Detection  (Shuyo, 2010) . Other answers were classified with methods we proposed. The evaluation results for English subtask A submissions are shown in table 1. The primary submission was gotten by two-level hierarchical classification method: in the first level, answers were classified into good_potential and bad_dialogue. In the second level, good_potential answers and bad_dialogue answers were classified separately: good_potential answers were classified into good and potential, bad_dialogue answers were classified into bad and dialogue. The classifiers used here were SVM which were trained using toolkit LIBLINEAR. In contrastive1 submission, two-level hierarchical classification method was used, and a special ensemble learning method was designed for potential answers classifying. The potential class answers were classified using ensemble learning method in the first level. The other 3 classes an-swers were classified in the second level. The ensemble learning method for potential answers classification using 5 binary classifiers: 3 goodpotential classifiers trained using different training data; 1 bad-potential classifier and 1 dialoguepotential classifier. The training data for goodpotential classifiers was gotten by random splitting good answers into 3 parts. Classifiers used for the contrastive1 submission were SVM trained with toolkit LIBLINEAR. Steps for getting the contrastive2 submission were similar to the primary submission. The difference was that the first level classifier was trained using Random Forest algorithm  (Breiman, 2001) . The training data good-potential classifier was resampled to balance the instance distribution between good and potential class. Features employed for English subtask A includes 4044 features: the top 4000 frequent n-gram terms and the top 44 maximum gain ratio features of all the features described in section 2.1 except the "Frequent n-gram term features". 

 Results of English subtask B Three submissions were submitted for English subtask B including primary submission, contrastive1 submission and contrastive2 submission. The evaluation results are presented in table 2. For the primary submission, answers in YES_NO question answer list were classified into 5 classes. Steps to classify answers in CGOLD_YN dimension were: first, a rule based method was used to classify answers; second, ensemble learning method was used to classify the answers that cannot be classified by rule based method. Classifiers used in ensemble learning method include: SMO (sequential minimal optimization algorithm for SVM)  (Keerthi et al., 2001) , Random Forest, DMNBtext (Discriminative Multinomial Na?ve Bayes)  (Su et al., 2008), Logistic Regression (Le Cessie and Van Houwelingen, 1992)  and RBFNetwork (normalized Gaussian radial basis function network). Those classifiers were the top 5 best of all classifiers have been tried based on 10 folds cross valida-tion on training data. Features employed for the primary submission include 187 features, which were the top 187 maximum gain ratio features of the 4400 features used in English task A. The contrastive1 submission and contrastive2 submission were based on the good answers in English subtask A primary submission. Only good answers of YES_NO question in subtask A primary submission were classified in CGOLD_YN dimension. Good answers of YES_NO question were classified into: yes, no and unsure. For the contrastive1 submission, good class answers were classified with ensemble learning method. Classifiers used for the ensemble learning method included the top 5 best classifiers for answer classification in CGOLD_YN dimension: SMO, Random Forest, DMNBtext, Logistic Regression and LMT (logistic model tree)  (Sumner et al., 2005) . For the contrastive2 submission, only classifier LMT, which was the best classifier of all classifiers tried based on 10 folds cross validation results on training data, was used to classify good answers. Features employed for the contrastive1 and con-trastive2 submission include 110 features, which were the top 110 maximum gain ratio features of the 4400 features used in English task A. 

 Results of Arabic task Answers were classified into 3 classes in Arabic task: direct, related, and irrelevant. Evaluation results for Arabic task are presented in table  3 . The primary submission was gotten by ensemble learning method using 3 classifiers. The classifiers were top 3 classifiers chosen based on 10 folds cross validation results on training data: SMO, REPTree (decision/regression tree) and J48graft (grafted C4.5 decision tree)  (Webb, 1999) . The contrastive1 submission was gotten by twolevel hierarchical classification method: in the first level, answers were classified into irrelevant and not irrelevant; in the second level, not irrelevant answers were classified into direct and related. All classifiers were trained using SMO algorithm. The contrastive2 submission was gotten only by SMO classifier. The SMO classifier was trained as multi-class classifier to classify answers into direct, related and irrelevant. Features employed for Arabic task include 5049 features: the top 5000 frequent n-gram terms and the top 49 maximum gain ratio features of all the features described in section 2.3 except "Frequent n-gram term features". 

 Discussion In English subtask A, performance of the submission contrastive1, the hierarchical classification method result, was better than other submissions. The performance of hierarchical classification method was also better than other submission in Arabic task. This shows that the hierarchical classification method is effective for answer selection task. The performances on different class varied from each other remarkable for English subtask A and Arabic task as shown in table 4. It is difficult to distinguish the potentially useful class answers for all classification methods that have been tried. Analysis on feature extraction showed that, most features were extracted to judge whether the answer was good or bad, but few features were extracted to judge whether the answer was potentially useful. In English subtask B, performance on primary submission, which was result of one-step classification method on all answers of YES_NO question, was much better than other submissions which were results of two-step classification method. The results showed that cascade error of piping classifiers for answer classification in CGOLD and answer classification in CGOLD_YN had great im-

 Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we presented multi-classifier ensemble method and hierarchical classification method proposed for each subtask in SemEval-2015 Task 3. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed classification methods were effective in both English and Arabic subtasks. In the next stage, syntax feature and deep semantic feature will be exploited to further improve the performance of our approaches. Besides, more effective features for potential answers classification will also be explored. Data sets used for classifiers training includes the training and development data provided. No external data was used for classifiers training.
