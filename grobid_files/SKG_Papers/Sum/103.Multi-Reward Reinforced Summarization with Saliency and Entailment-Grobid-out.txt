Multi-Reward Reinforced Summarization with Saliency and Entailment

abstract
Abstractive text summarization is the task of compressing and rewriting a long document into a short summary while maintaining saliency, directed logical entailment, and non-redundancy. In this work, we address these three important aspects of a good summary via a reinforcement learning approach with two novel reward functions: ROUGE-Sal and Entail, on top of a coverage-based baseline. The ROUGESal reward modifies the ROUGE metric by up-weighting the salient phrases/words detected via a keyphrase classifier. The Entail reward gives high (lengthnormalized) scores to logically-entailed summaries using an entailment classifier. Further, we show superior performance improvement when these rewards are combined with traditional metric (ROUGE) based rewards, via our novel and effective multi-reward approach of optimizing multiple rewards simultaneously in alternate mini-batches. Our method achieves the new state-of-the-art results on CNN/Daily Mail dataset as well as strong improvements in a test-only transfer setup on DUC-2002.

Introduction Abstractive summarization, the task of generating a natural short summary of a long document, is more challenging than the extractive paradigm, which only involves selection of important sentences or grammatical sub-sentences  (Jing, 2000; Knight and Marcu, 2002; Clarke and Lapata, 2008; Filippova et al., 2015) . Advent of sequence-to-sequence deep neural networks and large human summarization datasets  (Hermann et al., 2015; Nallapati et al., 2016)  made the abstractive summarization task more feasible and accurate, with recent ideas ranging from copypointer mechanism and redundancy coverage, to metric reward based reinforcement learning  (Rush et al., 2015; Chopra et al., 2016; Ranzato et al., 2015; Nallapati et al., 2016; See et al., 2017) . A good abstractive summary requires several important properties, e.g., it should choose the most salient information from the input document, be logically entailed by it, and avoid redundancy. Coverage-based models address the latter redundancy issue  (Suzuki and Nagata, 2016; Nallapati et al., 2016; See et al., 2017) , but there is still a lot of scope to teach current state-of-the-art models about saliency and logical entailment. Towards this goal, we improve the task of abstractive summarization via a reinforcement learning approach with the introduction of two novel rewards: 'ROUGESal' and 'Entail', and also demonstrate that these saliency and entailment skills allow for better generalizability and transfer. Our ROUGESal reward gives higher weight to the important, salient words in the summary, in contrast to the traditional ROUGE metric which gives equal weight to all tokens. These weights are obtained from a novel saliency scorer, which is trained on a reading comprehension dataset's answer spans to give a saliency-based probability score to every token in the sentence. Our Entail reward gives higher weight to summaries whose sentences logically follow from the ground-truth summary. Further, we also add a length normalization constraint to our Entail reward, to importantly avoid misleadingly high entailment scores to very short sentences. Empirically, we show that our new rewards with policy gradient approaches perform significantly better than a cross-entropy based state-of-the-art pointer-coverage baseline. We show further performance improvements by combining these rewards via our novel multi-reward optimization approach, where we optimize multiple rewards simultaneously in alternate mini-batches (hence avoiding complex scaling and weighting issues in reward combination), inspired from how humans take multiple concurrent types of rewards (feedback) to learn a task. Overall, our methods achieve the new state-of-the-art on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset as well as strong improvements in a testonly transfer setup on DUC-2002. Lastly, we present several analyses of our model's saliency, entailment, and abstractiveness skills. 

 Related Work Earlier summarization work was based on extraction and compression-based approaches  (Jing, 2000; Knight and Marcu, 2002; Clarke and Lapata, 2008; Filippova et al., 2015) , with more focus on graph-based  (Giannakopoulos, 2009; Ganesan et al., 2010)  and discourse tree-based  (Gerani et al., 2014)  models. Recent focus has shifted towards abstractive, rewriting-based summarization based on parse trees  (Cheung and Penn, 2014; Wang et al., 2016) , Abstract Meaning Representations  (Liu et al., 2015; Dohare and Karnick, 2017) , and neural network models with pointercopy mechanism and coverage  (Rush et al., 2015; Chopra et al., 2016; Nallapati et al., 2016; See et al., 2017) , as well as reinforcebased metric rewards  (Ranzato et al., 2015; Paulus et al., 2017) . We also use reinforce-based models, but with novel reward functions and better simultaneous multi-reward optimization methods. Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE), the task of classifying two sentences as entailment, contradiction, or neutral, has been used for Q&A and IE tasks  (Harabagiu and Hickl, 2006; Dagan et al., 2006; Lai and Hockenmaier, 2014; Jimenez et al., 2014) . Recent neural network models and large datasets  (Bowman et al., 2015; Williams et al., 2017)  enabled stronger accuracies. Some previous work  (Mehdad et al., 2013; Gupta et al., 2014)  has explored the use of RTE by modeling graphbased relationships between sentences to select the most non-redundant sentences for summarization. Recently,  Pasunuru and Bansal (2017)  improved video captioning with entailment-corrected rewards. We instead directly use multi-sentence entailment knowledge (with additional length constraints) as a separate RL reward to improve abstractive summarization, while avoiding their penalty hyperparameter tuning. For our saliency prediction model, we make use of the SQuAD reading comprehension dataset  (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) , where the answer spans annotated by humans for important questions, serve as an interesting and effective proxy for keyphrase-style salient information in summarization. Some related previous work has incorporated document topic/subject classification  (Isonuma et al., 2017)  and webpage keyphrase extraction  (Zhang et al., 2004)  to improve saliency in summarization. Some recent work  Subramanian et al. (2017)  has also used answer probabilities in a document to improve question generation. 

 Models 

 Baseline Sequence-to-Sequence Model Our abstractive text summarization model is a simple sequence-to-sequence single-layer bidirectional encoder and unidirectional decoder LSTM-RNN, with attention  (Bahdanau et al., 2015) , pointer-copy, and coverage mechanism -please refer to  See et al. (2017)  for details. 

 Policy Gradient Reinforce Traditional cross-entropy loss optimization for sequence generation has an exposure bias issue and the model is not optimized for the evaluated metrics  (Ranzato et al., 2015) . Reinforce-based policy gradient approach addresses both of these issues by using its own distribution during training and by directly optimizing the non-differentiable evaluation metrics as rewards. We use the RE-INFORCE algorithm  (Williams, 1992; Zaremba and Sutskever, 2015)  to learn a policy p ? defined by the model parameters ? to predict the next action (word) and update its internal (LSTM) states. We minimize the loss function L RL = ?E w s ?p ? [r(w s )], where w s is the sequence of sampled words with w s t sampled at time step t of the decoder. The derivative of this loss function with approximation using a single sample along with variance reduction with a bias estimator is: ? ? L RL = ?(r(w s ) ? b e )? ? log p ? (w s ) (1) There are several ways to calculate the baseline estimator; we employ the effective SCST approach  (Rennie et al., 2016) , as depicted in Fig.  1 , where b e = r(w a ), is based on the reward obtained by the current model using the test time inference algorithm, i.e., choosing the arg-max word w a t of the final vocabulary distribution at each time step t of the decoder. We use the joint cross-entropy and reinforce loss so as to optimize the non-differentiable evaluation metric as reward while also maintaining the readability of the generated sentence  (Wu et al., 2016; Paulus et al., 2017; Pasunuru and Bansal, 2017) , which is defined as L Mixed = ?L RL + (1 ? ?)L XE , where ? is a tunable hyperparameter. 

 Multi-reward Optimization Optimizing multiple rewards at the same time is important and desired for many language generation tasks. One approach would be to use a weighted combination of these rewards, but this has the issue of finding the complex scaling and weight balance among these reward combinations. To address this issue, we instead introduce a simple multi-reward optimization approach inspired from multi-task learning, where we have different tasks, and all of them share all the model parameters while having their own optimization function (different reward functions in this case). If r 1 and r 2 are two reward functions that we want to optimize simultaneously, then we train the two loss functions of Eqn. 2 in alternate mini-batches. L RL 1 = ?(r 1 (w s ) ? r 1 (w a ))? ? log p ? (w s ) L RL 2 = ?(r 2 (w s ) ? r 2 (w a ))? ? log p ? (w s ) (2) 4 Rewards 

 ROUGE Reward The first basic reward is based on the primary summarization metric of ROUGE package  (Lin, 2004)    To learn these saliency weights, we train our saliency predictor on sentence and answer spans pairs from the popular SQuAD reading comprehension dataset  (Rajpurkar et al., 2016 )) (Wikipedia domain), where we treat the humanannotated answer spans (avg. span length 3.2) for important questions as representative salient information in the document. As shown in Fig.  2 , given a sentence as input, the predictor assigns a saliency probability to every token, using a simple bidirectional encoder with a softmax layer at every time step of the encoder hidden states to classify the token as salient or not. Finally, we use the probabilities given by this saliency prediction model as weights in the ROUGE matching formulation to achieve the final ROUGESal score (see appendix for details about our ROUGESal weighted precision, recall, and F-1 formulations). Entailment Rewards A good summary should also be logically entailed by the given source document, i.e., contain no contradictory or unrelated information.  Pasunuru and Bansal (2017)  used entailment-corrected phrase-matching metrics (CIDEnt) to improve the task of video captioning; we instead directly use the entailment knowledge from an entailment scorer and its multisentence, length-normalized extension as our 'Entail' reward, to improve the task of abstractive text summarization. We train the entailment classifier  (Parikh et al., 2016)     (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) . All dataset splits and other training details (dimension sizes, learning rates, etc.) for reproducibility are in appendix. 

 Evaluation Metrics We use the standard ROUGE package  (Lin, 2004)  and Meteor package  (Denkowski and Lavie, 2014)  for reporting the results on all of our summarization models. Following previous work  (Chopra et al., 2016; Nallapati et al., 2016; See et al., 2017) , we use the ROUGE full-length F1 variant. 

 Results Baseline Cross-entropy Model Our abstractive summarization model has attention, pointer-copy, and coverage mechanism. First, we apply crossentropy optimization and achieve comparable re-2 Since the GT summary is correctly entailed by the source document, we directly (by transitivity) use this GT as premise for easier (shorter) encoding. We also tried using the full input document as premise but this didn't perform as well (most likely because the entailment classifiers are not trained on such long premises; and the problem with the sentence-tosentence avg. scoring approach is discussed below). We also tried summary-to-summary entailment scoring (similar to ROUGE-L) as well as pairwise sentence-to-sentence avg. scoring, but we found that avg. scoring of groundtruth summary (as premise) w.r.t. each generated summary's sentence (as hypothesis) works better (intuitive because each sentence in generated summary might be a compression of multiple sentences of GT summary or source document). ROUGE metrics. Finally, we combined our two rewards ROUGESal+Entail to incorporate both saliency and entailment knowledge, and it gives the best results overall (p < 0.001 in all metrics w.r.t. both baseline and ROUGE-reward models), setting the new state-of-the-art.  5  Test-Only Transfer (DUC-2002) Results Finally, we also tested our model's generalizability/transfer skills, where we take the models trained on CNN/Daily Mail and directly test them on DUC-2002 in a test-only setup. As shown in Table  2 , our final ROUGESal+Entail multi-reward RL model is statistically significantly better than both the cross-entropy (pointer-generator + coverage) baseline as well as ROUGE reward RL model, in terms of all 4 metrics with a large margin (with p < 0.001). This demonstrates that our ROUGESal+Entail model learned better transferable and generalizable skills of saliency and logical entailment. 

 Output Analysis Saliency Analysis We analyzed the output summaries generated by  See et al. (2017) , and our baseline, ROUGE-reward and ROUGESal-reward models, using our saliency prediction model (Sec. 4), and the scores are 27.95%, 28.00%, 28.80%, and 30.86%. We also used the original CNN/Daily Mail Cloze Q&A setup  (Hermann et al., 2015)  with the fill-in-the-blank answers treated as salient information, and the results are 60.66%, 59.36%, 60.67%, and 64.66% for the four models. Both these experiments illustrate that our ROUGESal reward model is stat. signif. better in saliency than the  See et al. (2017) , our baseline, and ROUGE-reward models (p < 0.001). 

 Entailment Analysis We also analyzed the entailment scores of the generated summaries from  See et al. (2017) , and our baseline, ROUGEreward, and Entail-reward models, and the results are 27.33%, 27.21%, 28.23%, and 28.98%. We observe that our Entail-reward model achieves stat. significant entailment scores (p < 0.001) w.r.t. all the other three models. Abstractiveness Analysis In order to measure the abstractiveness of our models, we followed the 'novel n-gram overlap' approach suggested in  See et al. (2017) . First, we found that all our rewardbased RL models have significantly (p < 0.01) more novel n-grams than our cross-entropy baseline (see Table  3 ). Next, the Entail-reward model 'maintains' stat. equal abstractiveness as the ROUGE-reward model, likely because it encourages rewriting to create logical subsets of information, while the ROUGESal-reward model does a bit worse, probably because it focuses on copying more salient information (e.g., names). Compared to previous work  (See et al., 2017) , our Entailreward and ROUGE-reward models achieve statistically significant improvement (p < 0.01) while ROUGESal is comparable. 

 Conclusion We presented a summarization model trained with novel RL reward functions to improve the saliency and directed logical entailment aspects of a good summary. Further, we introduced the novel and effective multi-reward approach of optimizing multiple rewards simultaneously in alternate minibatches. We achieve the new state-of-the-art on CNN/Daily Mail and also strong test-only improvements on a DUC-2002 transfer setup.
