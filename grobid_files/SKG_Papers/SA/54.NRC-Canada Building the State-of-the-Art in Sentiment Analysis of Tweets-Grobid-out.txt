NRC-Canada: Building the State-of-the-Art in Sentiment Analysis of Tweets

abstract
In this paper, we describe how we created two state-of-the-art SVM classifiers, one to detect the sentiment of messages such as tweets and SMS (message-level task) and one to detect the sentiment of a term within a message (term-level task). Among submissions from 44 teams in a competition, our submissions stood first in both tasks on tweets, obtaining an F-score of 69.02 in the message-level task and 88.93 in the term-level task. We implemented a variety of surface-form, semantic, and sentiment features. We also generated two large word-sentiment association lexicons, one from tweets with sentiment-word hashtags, and one from tweets with emoticons. In the message-level task, the lexicon-based features provided a gain of 5 F-score points over all others. Both of our systems can be replicated using freely available resources. 1

Introduction Hundreds of millions of people around the world actively use microblogging websites such as Twitter. Thus there is tremendous interest in sentiment analysis of tweets across a variety of domains such as commerce  (Jansen et al., 2009) , health  (Chew and Eysenbach, 2010; Salath? and Khandelwal, 2011) , and disaster management  (Verma et al., 2011; Mandel et al., 2012) . In this paper, we describe how we created two state-of-the-art SVM classifiers, one to detect the sentiment of messages such as tweets and SMS (message-level task) and one to detect the sentiment of a term within a message (term-level task). The sentiment can be one out of three possibilities: positive, negative, or neutral. We developed these classifiers to participate in an international competition organized by the Conference on Semantic Evaluation Exercises (SemEval-2013)  (Wilson et al., 2013) .  2  The organizers created and shared sentiment-labeled tweets for training, development, and testing. The distributions of the labels in the different datasets is shown in Table  1 . The competition, officially referred to as Task 2: Sentiment Analysis in Twitter, had 44 teams (34 for the message-level task and 23 for the term-level task). Our submissions stood first in both tasks, obtaining a macro-averaged F-score of 69.02 in the message-level task and 88.93 in the term-level task. The task organizers also provided a second test dataset, composed of Short Message Service (SMS) messages (no training data of SMS messages was provided). We applied our classifiers on the SMS test set without any further tuning. Nonetheless, the classifiers still obtained the first position in identifying sentiment of SMS messages (F-score of 68.46) and second position in detecting the sentiment of terms within SMS messages (F-score of 88.00, only 0.39 points behind the first ranked system). We implemented a number of surface-form, semantic, and sentiment features. We also generated two large word-sentiment association lexicons, one from tweets with sentiment-word hashtags, and one from tweets with emoticons. The automatically generated lexicons were particularly useful. In the message-level task for tweets, they alone provided a gain of more than 5 F-score points over and above that obtained using all other features. The lexicons are made freely available. 3 

 Sentiment Lexicons Sentiment lexicons are lists of words with associations to positive and negative sentiments. 

 Existing, Automatically Created Sentiment Lexicons The manually created lexicons we used include the NRC Emotion Lexicon  (Mohammad and Turney, 2010; Mohammad and Yang, 2011)  (about 14,000 words), the MPQA Lexicon  (Wilson et al., 2005)  (about 8,000 words), and the Bing Liu Lexicon  (Hu and Liu, 2004 ) (about 6,800 words). 2.2 New, Tweet-Specific, Automatically Generated Sentiment Lexicons 

 NRC Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon Certain words in tweets are specially marked with a hashtag (#) to indicate the topic or sentiment. Mo-3 www.purl.com/net/sentimentoftweets hammad (2012) showed that hashtagged emotion words such as joy, sadness, angry, and surprised are good indicators that the tweet as a whole (even without the hashtagged emotion word) is expressing the same emotion. We adapted that idea to create a large corpus of positive and negative tweets. We polled the Twitter API every four hours from April to December 2012 in search of tweets with either a positive word hashtag or a negative word hashtag. A collection of 78 seed words closely related to positive and negative such as #good, #excellent, #bad, and #terrible were used (32 positive and 36 negative). These terms were chosen from entries for positive and negative in the Roget's Thesaurus. A set of 775,000 tweets were used to generate a large word-sentiment association lexicon. A tweet was considered positive if it had one of the 32 positive hashtagged seed words, and negative if it had one of the 36 negative hashtagged seed words. The association score for a term w was calculated from these pseudo-labeled tweets as shown below: score(w) = P M I(w, positive) ? P M I(w, negative) (1) where PMI stands for pointwise mutual information. A positive score indicates association with positive sentiment, whereas a negative score indicates association with negative sentiment. The magnitude is indicative of the degree of association. The final lexicon, which we will refer to as the NRC Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon has entries for 54,129 unigrams and 316,531 bigrams. Entries were also generated for unigram-unigram, unigram-bigram, and bigram-bigram pairs that were not necessarily contiguous in the tweets corpus. Pairs with certain punctuations, '@' symbols, and some function words were removed. The lexicon has entries for 308,808 non-contiguous pairs. 

 Sentiment140 Lexicon The sentiment140 corpus  (Go et al., 2009 ) is a collection of 1.6 million tweets that contain positive and negative emoticons. The tweets are labeled positive or negative according to the emoticon. We generated a sentiment lexicon from this corpus in the same manner as described above (Section 2.2.1). This lexicon has entries for 62,468 unigrams, 677,698 bigrams, and 480,010 noncontiguous pairs. 3 Task: Automatically Detecting the Sentiment of a Message The objective of this task is to determine whether a given message is positive, negative, or neutral. 

 Classifier and features We trained a Support Vector Machine (SVM)  (Fan et al., 2008)  on the training data provided. SVM is a state-of-the-art learning algorithm proved to be effective on text categorization tasks and robust on large feature spaces. The linear kernel and the value for the parameter C=0.005 were chosen by crossvalidation on the training data. We normalized all URLs to http://someurl and all userids to @someuser. We tokenized and part-ofspeech tagged the tweets with the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Twitter NLP tool  (Gimpel et al., 2011) . Each tweet was represented as a feature vector made up of the following groups of features: ? word ngrams: presence or absence of contiguous sequences of 1, 2, 3, and 4 tokens; noncontiguous ngrams (ngrams with one token replaced by *); ? character ngrams: presence or absence of contiguous sequences of 3, 4, and 5 characters; ? all-caps: the number of words with all characters in upper case; ? POS: the number of occurrences of each partof-speech tag; ? hashtags: the number of hashtags; ? lexicons: the following sets of features were generated for each of the three manually constructed sentiment lexicons (NRC Emotion Lexicon, MPQA, Bing Liu Lexicon) and for each of the two automatically constructed lexicons (Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon and Senti-ment140 Lexicon). Separate feature sets were produced for unigrams, bigrams, and noncontiguous pairs. The lexicon features were created for all tokens in the tweet, for each partof-speech tag, for hashtags, and for all-caps tokens. For each token w and emotion or polarity p, we used the sentiment/emotion score score(w, p) to determine: total count of tokens in the tweet with score(w, p) > 0; total score = w?tweet score(w, p); the maximal score = max w?tweet score(w, p); the score of the last token in the tweet with score(w, p) > 0; ? punctuation: the number of contiguous sequences of exclamation marks, question marks, and both exclamation and question marks; whether the last token contains an exclamation or question mark; ? emoticons: The polarity of an emoticon was determined with a regular expression adopted from Christopher Potts' tokenizing script: 4 presence or absence of positive and negative emoticons at any position in the tweet; whether the last token is a positive or negative emoticon; ? elongated words: the number of words with one character repeated more than two times, for example, 'soooo'; ? clusters: The CMU pos-tagging tool provides the token clusters produced with the Brown clustering algorithm on 56 million Englishlanguage tweets. These 1,000 clusters serve as alternative representation of tweet content, reducing the sparcity of the token space. the presence or absence of tokens from each of the 1000 clusters; ? negation: the number of negated contexts. Following  (Pang et al., 2002) , we defined a negated context as a segment of a tweet that starts with a negation word (e.g., no, shouldn't) and ends with one of the punctuation marks: ',', '.', ':', ';', '!', '?'. A negated context affects the ngram and lexicon features: we add ' NEG' suffix to each word following the negation word ('perfect' becomes 'perfect NEG'). The ' NEG' suffix is also added to polarity and emotion features ('POLARITY positive' becomes 'POLARITY positive NEG'). The list of negation words was adopted from Christopher Potts' sentiment tutorial. 5 

 Experiments We trained the SVM classifier on the set of 9,912 annotated tweets (8,258 in the training set and 1,654 in the development set). We applied the model to the test set of 3,813 unseen tweets. The same model was applied unchanged to the other test set of 2,094 SMS messages as well. The bottom-line score used by the task organizers was the macro-averaged F-score of the positive and negative classes. The results obtained by our system on the training set (ten-fold cross-validation), development set (when trained on the training set), and test sets (when trained on the combined set of tweets in the training and development sets) are shown in Table  2 . The table also shows baseline results obtained by a majority classifier that always predicts the most frequent class as output. Since the bottom-line F-score is based only on the F-scores of positive and negative classes (and not on neutral), the majority baseline chose the most frequent class among positive and negative, which in this case was the positive class. We also show baseline results obtained using an SVM and unigram features alone. Our system (SVM and all features) obtained a macro-averaged F-score of 69.02 on the tweet set and 68.46 on the SMS set. In the SemEval-2013 competition, our submission ranked first on both datasets. There were 48 submissions from 34 teams for this task. Table  3  shows the results of the ablation experiments where we repeat the same classification process but remove one feature group at a time. The most influential features for both datasets turned out to be the sentiment lexicon features: they provided gains of more than 8.5%. It is interesting to note that tweets benefited mostly from the automatic sentiment lexicons (NRC Hashtag Lexicon and the Sen-timent140 Lexicon) whereas the SMS set benefited more from the manual lexicons (MPQA, NRC Emotion Lexicon, Bing Liu Lexicon). Among the automatic lexicons, both the Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon and the Sentiment140 Lexicon contributed to roughly the same amount of improvement in performance on the tweet set. The second most important feature group for the message-level task was that of ngrams (word and character ngrams). Expectedly, the impact of ngrams on the SMS dataset was less extensive since the classifier model was trained only on tweets. Attention to negations improved performance on both datasets. Removing the sentiment encoding features like hashtags, emoticons, and elongated words, had almost no impact on performance, but this is probably because the discriminating information in them was also captured by some other features such as character and word ngrams. 

 Task: Automatically Detecting the Sentiment of a Term in a Message The objective of this task is to detect whether a term (a word or phrase) within a message conveys a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Note that the same term may express different sentiments in different contexts. 

 Classifier and features We trained an SVM using the LibSVM package  (Chang and Lin, 2011)  and a linear kernel. In tenfold cross-validation over the training data, the linear kernel outperformed other kernels implemented in LibSVM as well as a maximum-entropy classifier. Our model leverages a variety of features, as described below: ? word ngrams: presence or absence of unigrams, bigrams, and the full word string of a target term; leading and ending unigrams and bigrams; ? character ngrams: presence or absence of twoand three-character prefixes and suffixes of all the words in a target term (note that the target term may be a multi-word sequence); ? elongated words: presence or absence of elongated words (e.g., 'sooo'); ? emoticons: the numbers and categories of emoticons that a term contains 6 ; ? punctuation: presence or absence of punctuation sequences such as '?!' and '!!!'; ? upper case: whether all the words in the target start with an upper case letter followed by lower case letters; whether the target words are all in uppercase (to capture a potential named entity); ? stopwords: whether a term contains only stopwords. If so, separate features indicate whether there are 1, 2, 3, or more stop-words; ? lengths: the length of a target term (number of words); the average length of words (number of characters) in a term; a binary feature indicating whether a term contains long words; ? negation: similar to those described for the message-level task. Whenever a negation word was found immediately before the target or within the target, the polarities of all tokens after the negation term were flipped; ? position: whether a term is at the beginning, end, or another position; ? sentiment lexicons: we used automatically created lexicons (NRC Hashtag Sentiment Lexicon, Sentiment140 Lexicon) as well as manually created lexicons (NRC Emotion Lexicon, MPQA, Bing Liu Lexicon). total count of tokens in the target term with sentiment score greater than 0; the sum of the sentiment scores for all tokens in the target; the maximal sentiment score; the non-zero sentiment score of the last token in the target; ? term splitting: when a term contains a hashtag made of multiple words (e.g., #biggestdaythisyear), we split the hashtag into component words; ? others: whether a term contains a Twitter user name; whether a term contains a URL. The above features were extracted from target terms as well as from the rest of the message (the context). For unigrams and bigrams, we used four words on either side of the target as the context. The window size was chosen through experiments on the development set. 

 Experiments We trained an SVM classifier on the 8,891 annotated terms in tweets (7,756 terms in the training set and 1,135 terms in the development set). We applied the model to 4,435 terms in the tweets test set. The same model was applied unchanged to the other test set of 2,334 terms in unseen SMS messages as well. The bottom-line score used by the task organizers was the macro-averaged F-score of the positive and negative classes. The results on the training set (ten-fold crossvalidation), the development set (trained on the training set), and the test sets (trained on the combined set of tweets in the training and development sets) are shown in Table  4 . The table also shows baseline results obtained by a majority classifier that always predicts the most frequent class as output, and an additional baseline result obtained using an SVM and unigram features alone. Our submission obtained a macro-averaged F-score of 88.93 on the tweet set and was ranked first among 29 submissions from 23 participating teams. Even with no tuning specific to SMS data, our SMS submission still obtained second rank with an F-score of 88.00. The score of the first ranking system on the SMS set was 88.39. A post-competition bug-fix in the bigram features resulted in a small improvement: F-score of 89.10 on the tweets set and 88.34 on the SMS set. Note that the performance is significantly higher in the term-level task than in the message-level task. This is largely because of the ngram features (see unigram baselines in Tables  2 and 4 ). We analyzed the labeled data provided to determine why ngrams performed so strongly in this task. We found that the percentage of test tokens already seen within training data targets was 85.1%. Further, the average ratio of instances pertaining to the most dominant polarity of a target term to the total number of instances of that target term was 0.808. Table  5  presents the ablation F-scores. Observe that the ngram features were the most useful. Note also that removing just the word ngram features or just the character ngram features results in only a small drop in performance. This indicates that the two feature groups capture similar information. The sentiment lexicon features are the next most useful group-removing them leads to a drop in Fscore of 3.95 points for the tweets set and 4.64 for the SMS set. Modeling negation improves the Fscore by 0.72 points on the tweets set and 1.57 points on the SMS set. The last two rows in Table  5  show the results obtained when the features are extracted only from the target (and not from its context) and when they are extracted only from the context of the target (and not from the target itself). Observe that even though the context may influence the polarity of the target, using target features alone is substantially more useful than using context features alone. Nonetheless, adding context features improves the F-scores by roughly 2 to 4 points. 

 Conclusions We created two state-of-the-art SVM classifiers, one to detect the sentiment of messages and one to detect the sentiment of a term within a message. Our submissions on tweet data stood first in both these subtasks of the SemEval-2013 competition 'Detecting Sentiment in Twitter'. We implemented a variety of features based on surface form and lexical categories. The sentiment lexicon features (both manually created and automatically generated) along with ngram features (both word and character ngrams) led to the most gain in performance.
